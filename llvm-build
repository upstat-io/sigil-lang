# Build LLVM crate and runtime library in Docker container
# Usage: ./llvm-build [additional args...]
#
# Note: Both ori_llvm and ori_rt are built to ensure libori_rt.a is available
# for AOT compilation. Cargo only builds the rlib as a dependency; the staticlib
# is a separate artifact that must be explicitly requested.
