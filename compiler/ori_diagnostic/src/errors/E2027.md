# E2027: Ambiguous Index Key Type

A subscript expression `x[k]` was used on a type that has multiple `Index`
implementations, and the compiler cannot determine which one to use.

## Example

```ori
type JsonValue = { data: str }

impl Index<str, Option<JsonValue>> for JsonValue {
    @index (self, key: str) -> Option<JsonValue> = None
}

impl Index<int, Option<JsonValue>> for JsonValue {
    @index (self, key: int) -> Option<JsonValue> = None
}

// If the key type is ambiguous, this error is emitted.
```

## Explanation

When a type implements `Index` for multiple key types, the compiler must be
able to determine which implementation to use from the key expression's type.
If the key type is ambiguous (e.g., an unresolved type variable), the compiler
cannot choose between implementations.

## Solution

Ensure the key expression has a clear, unambiguous type, or add a type
annotation to disambiguate.
