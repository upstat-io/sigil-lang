# E2003: Unknown Identifier

A name was used that isn't defined in the current scope.

## Example

```ori
@main () -> void = run(
    print(msg: message)    // Error: unknown identifier `message`
)
```

## Explanation

You're trying to use a variable, function, or type that hasn't been defined.
This usually means:

- The name is misspelled
- The definition is in a different scope
- You forgot to import or define it

## Solutions

1. **Check spelling:**
   ```ori
   // Wrong
   let mesage = "Hello"
   print(msg: message)    // 'message' != 'mesage'

   // Right
   let message = "Hello"
   print(msg: message)
   ```

2. **Define before use:**
   ```ori
   // Wrong - x not defined yet
   let y = x + 1
   let x = 10

   // Right
   let x = 10
   let y = x + 1
   ```

3. **Import from other modules:**
   ```ori
   // Need to import sqrt before using it
   use std.math { sqrt }

   let root = sqrt(x: 16.0)
   ```

4. **Check scope:**
   ```ori
   // Wrong - inner is only visible inside the if
   if condition then run(
       let inner = 42
   ) else run(
       print(msg: str(inner))    // Error: inner not in scope
   )

   // Right - define at outer scope
   let inner = if condition then 42 else 0
   ```
