# E2032: Field Type Missing Trait in Derive

A `#[derive(Trait)]` attribute was applied to a type, but one of its fields
does not implement the required trait.

## Example

```ori
type FileHandle = { fd: int }

#[derive(Eq)]
type Container = { data: FileHandle }
//                 ^^^^ FileHandle does not implement Eq
```

## Explanation

When deriving a trait for a composite type (struct or sum type), every field
must implement that same trait. The derived implementation calls the trait
method on each field, so if any field lacks the trait, the derivation is
impossible.

For example, `derive(Eq)` generates field-by-field equality comparison. If a
field's type doesn't support `==`, the derived `eq` method cannot compare it.

## Solution

Either derive or manually implement the required trait on the field type:

```ori
#[derive(Eq)]
type FileHandle = { fd: int }

#[derive(Eq)]
type Container = { data: FileHandle }
```

Or implement the trait manually if the derived behavior isn't appropriate:

```ori
impl Eq for Container {
    @eq (self, other: Container) -> bool = self.data.fd == other.data.fd
}
```
