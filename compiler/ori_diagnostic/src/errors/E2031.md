# E2031: Type Cannot Be Used as Map Key

A type that does not implement `Hashable` was used as a map key type or set
element type.

## Example

```ori
type Point = { x: int, y: int }

let map: {Point: int} = {}  // error: Point cannot be used as map key
```

## Explanation

Map keys and set elements require the `Hashable` trait for hash-based lookup.
Without `Hashable`, the runtime cannot compute hash values needed for O(1)
key lookup in maps and sets.

## Solution

Add `Eq` and `Hashable` to the type's derive list:

```ori
#[derive(Eq, Hashable)]
type Point = { x: int, y: int }

let map: {Point: int} = {}  // now works
```
