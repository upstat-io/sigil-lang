# E2019: Uninhabited Struct Field

A struct field has type `Never`, which makes the struct unconstructable.

## Example

```ori
type Bad = { value: int, impossible: Never }
```

## Explanation

The `Never` type has no values — no expression can produce a `Never` value under
normal control flow. A struct requires values for all its fields to construct,
so a `Never` field makes the entire struct impossible to create.

This restriction applies only to struct fields. Sum type variants *may* carry
`Never` payloads, which makes those variants uninhabited (unconstructable) while
other variants remain usable:

```ori
type MaybeNever = Value(int) | Impossible(Never)
// Only Value(int) values can exist; Impossible is unreachable
```

## Common Causes

1. **Using `Never` where `Option<T>` is intended:**
   ```ori
   // Wrong — makes the struct unconstructable
   type Config = { callback: Never }

   // Right — callback is optional
   type Config = { callback: Option<() -> void> }
   ```

2. **Using `Never` where a generic type parameter is intended:**
   ```ori
   // Wrong — unconstructable
   type Container = { item: Never }

   // Right — parameterize the type
   type Container<T> = { item: T }
   ```
