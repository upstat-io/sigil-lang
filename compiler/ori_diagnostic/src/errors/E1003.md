# E1003: Unclosed Delimiter

A bracket, parenthesis, or brace was opened but never closed.

## Example

```ori
@main () -> void = run(
    let list = [1, 2, 3    // Error: unclosed '['
)
```

## Explanation

Delimiters in Ori must always be balanced:
- `(` must have a matching `)`
- `[` must have a matching `]`
- `{` must have a matching `}`

## Solutions

1. **Add the missing closing delimiter:**
   ```ori
   // Wrong
   let list = [1, 2, 3

   // Right
   let list = [1, 2, 3]
   ```

2. **Check for nested delimiters:**
   ```ori
   // Wrong - missing ) for inner call
   print(msg: str(add(a: 1, b: 2)

   // Right
   print(msg: str(add(a: 1, b: 2)))
   ```

3. **Use proper formatting to spot mismatches:**
   ```ori
   // Hard to spot the error
   let result = foo(bar(baz(x, y), z)

   // Easier with formatting
   let result = foo(
       bar(
           baz(x, y),
           z,
       ),    // <- now we can see foo( needs closing
   )
   ```

## Tips

- Most editors highlight matching delimiters
- Use auto-formatting (`ori fmt`) to catch these issues early
- Count opening and closing delimiters if you're stuck
