# E2028: Cannot Derive Default for Sum Type

`#[derive(Default)]` was applied to a sum type (enum), which is not allowed
because there is no unambiguous default variant.

## Example

```ori
#[derive(Default)]  // error: cannot derive Default for sum type
type Status = Pending | Running | Done
```

## Explanation

The `Default` trait provides a zero/empty value for a type. For struct types,
the default is field-wise construction using each field's default value. For
sum types, the compiler cannot determine which variant should be the default —
choosing `Pending` vs `Running` vs `Done` is an arbitrary design decision that
must be made explicitly.

## Solution

Remove `Default` from the derive list. If a default value is needed, implement
the trait manually by choosing a specific variant:

```ori
type Status = Pending | Running | Done

impl Default for Status {
    @default () -> Status = Pending
}
```
