# E2030: Hashable Implementation May Violate Hash Invariant

A type's `Hashable` and `Eq` implementations may be inconsistent. The hash
invariant requires: if `a == b` then `a.hash() == b.hash()`.

## Example

This error is emitted when the compiler detects that a type's hash and equality
implementations may use different sets of fields or different logic, potentially
violating the hash invariant.

## Explanation

When `Hashable` and `Eq` are implemented separately (one derived, one manual),
there is a risk that the implementations disagree on which fields matter. For
example, a manual `Eq` that ignores a field while a derived `Hashable` includes
all fields would violate the invariant.

## Solution

Ensure both implementations use the same fields and logic:

```ori
#[derive(Eq, Hashable)]  // both use all fields consistently
type Point = { x: int, y: int }
```

Or implement both manually with matching logic.
