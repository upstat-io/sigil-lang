# E9002: Too Many Errors

The compiler stopped because the error limit was reached.

## Example

```
error[E9002]: aborting due to 100 previous errors
  |
  = note: more errors may exist but are not shown
  = help: fix the errors above and recompile
```

## Explanation

The Ori compiler limits the number of errors it reports to prevent
overwhelming output. When this limit is reached, it stops processing
and reports this error.

The default limit is 100 errors.

## Why This Happens

1. **Cascade errors:** One mistake can cause many follow-on errors
2. **Many related issues:** Multiple instances of the same problem
3. **Fundamental issue:** An early error affects most of the code

## What To Do

1. **Fix errors from the top:**
   - Start with the first error reported
   - Many later errors may be caused by earlier ones
   - Recompile after fixing each batch

2. **Look for patterns:**
   - Are many errors the same type?
   - Is there a common root cause?
   - Did a refactor break something fundamental?

3. **Fix in batches:**
   ```bash
   # Fix a few errors, then recompile
   ori check src/

   # Repeat until all errors are fixed
   ```

## Configuring the Limit

```bash
# Show more errors before stopping
ori check --error-limit 200 src/

# Show all errors (not recommended for large codebases)
ori check --error-limit 0 src/
```

## Common Scenarios

### Import Error
A broken import can cause "unknown identifier" errors everywhere:
```ori
// If this import fails...
use './utils' { helper }

// ...every use of 'helper' becomes an error
helper(x)    // Error: unknown identifier
helper(y)    // Error: unknown identifier
// ... many more
```

**Fix:** Resolve the import first, then recompile.

### Type Definition Error
A malformed type can cause cascading type errors:
```ori
// If this has an error...
type User = { name: str, age: }

// ...every use of User fails
@get_user () -> User = ...    // Error
@save_user (u: User) -> ... = ...    // Error
```

**Fix:** Fix the type definition first.

### Missing Dependency
A missing function causes errors at every call site:
```ori
// If 'process' doesn't exist...
@a () -> int = process(x: 1)    // Error
@b () -> int = process(x: 2)    // Error
@c () -> int = process(x: 3)    // Error
```
