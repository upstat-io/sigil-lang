# E0004: Unterminated Character Literal

A character literal was started but not closed before the end of the line or file.

## Example

```ori
@main () -> void = run(
    let c = 'a    // Error: character literal not terminated
)
```

## Explanation

Character literals in Ori must be enclosed in single quotes (`'`). A character
literal represents a single Unicode codepoint.

Common causes:
- Forgetting the closing quote
- Trying to use single quotes for strings (use double quotes instead)
- Empty character literal (`''` is not valid)

## Solutions

1. **Add the closing quote:**
   ```ori
   let c = 'a'
   ```

2. **For strings, use double quotes:**
   ```ori
   // Wrong: single quotes are for characters only
   let s = 'hello'

   // Right: use double quotes for strings
   let s = "hello"
   ```

3. **For escape sequences in characters:**
   ```ori
   let newline = '\n'
   let tab = '\t'
   let quote = '\''
   ```

## Character vs String

In Ori:
- `'a'` is a `char` - a single Unicode codepoint
- `"a"` is a `str` - a string (which can also hold a single character)
