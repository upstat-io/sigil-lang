# E2029: Cannot Derive Hashable Without Eq

`#[derive(Hashable)]` was applied to a type that does not also derive or
implement `Eq`. The hash invariant requires that equal values produce equal
hashes: if `a == b` then `a.hash() == b.hash()`.

## Example

```ori
#[derive(Hashable)]  // error: cannot derive Hashable without Eq
type Point = { x: int, y: int }
```

## Explanation

The `Hashable` trait generates hash values for use in hash maps and sets. For
correct behavior, the hash function must be consistent with equality: two values
that compare as equal must have the same hash. Without an `Eq` implementation,
this invariant cannot be guaranteed.

## Solution

Add `Eq` to the derive list alongside `Hashable`:

```ori
#[derive(Eq, Hashable)]
type Point = { x: int, y: int }
```

Or implement `Eq` manually if custom equality logic is needed.
