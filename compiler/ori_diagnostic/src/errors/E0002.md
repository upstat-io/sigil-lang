# E0002: Invalid Character

The source file contains a character that isn't valid in Ori source code.

## Example

```ori
@main () -> void = run(
    let x = 42 § 2    // Error: invalid character '§'
)
```

## Explanation

Ori source files must contain only valid UTF-8 characters, and certain
characters are not allowed outside of string literals or comments.

## Common Causes

1. **Copy-pasting from documents** - Word processors often use "smart quotes"
   or other special characters
2. **Wrong keyboard layout** - Accidentally typing special characters
3. **File encoding issues** - File not saved as UTF-8

## Solutions

1. **Replace smart quotes with regular quotes:**
   ```ori
   // Wrong - smart quotes from Word/Pages
   let s = "hello"

   // Right - regular ASCII quotes
   let s = "hello"
   ```

2. **Use standard operators:**
   ```ori
   // Wrong - multiplication symbol ×
   let x = 2 × 3

   // Right - asterisk *
   let x = 2 * 3
   ```

3. **Check file encoding:**
   - Save your file as UTF-8
   - Remove any BOM (Byte Order Mark) if present

4. **Special characters are allowed in strings:**
   ```ori
   let emoji = "Hello! 👋"    // OK inside string
   ```
