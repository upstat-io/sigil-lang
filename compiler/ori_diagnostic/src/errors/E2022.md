# E2022: Conflicting Default Methods

Multiple super-traits provide different default implementations for the same
method, and the impl does not override it.

## Example

```ori
trait A {
    @greet (self) -> str = "Hello from A"
}

trait B {
    @greet (self) -> str = "Hello from B"
}

trait C: A + B {
    // C inherits conflicting defaults for `greet`
}

type Widget = { name: str }

impl A for Widget {}
impl B for Widget {}
impl C for Widget {}    // Error: conflicting defaults for `greet`
```

## Explanation

When a trait inherits from multiple super-traits that each provide a default
method with the same name, the compiler cannot determine which default to use.
This is the "diamond problem" in trait inheritance.

## Solution

Provide an explicit implementation to resolve the conflict:

```ori
impl C for Widget {
    @greet (self) -> str = "Hello from Widget"    // Resolves conflict
}
```
