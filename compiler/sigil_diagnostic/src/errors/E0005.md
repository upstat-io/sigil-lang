# E0005: Invalid Escape Sequence

An unrecognized escape sequence was used in a string or character literal.

## Example

```sigil
@main () -> void = run(
    let s = "\q"    // Error: invalid escape sequence '\q'
)
```

## Explanation

Escape sequences in Sigil start with a backslash (`\`) followed by a specific
character. Only certain escape sequences are valid.

## Valid Escape Sequences

| Escape | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| `\\` | Backslash |
| `\"` | Double quote |
| `\'` | Single quote (in char literals) |
| `\n` | Newline |
| `\t` | Tab |
| `\r` | Carriage return |
| `\0` | Null character |

## Solutions

1. **Use a valid escape sequence:**
   ```sigil
   // Wrong
   let s = "\q"

   // Right - if you meant a literal backslash and q
   let s = "\\q"
   ```

2. **For literal backslashes, escape them:**
   ```sigil
   // Windows path example
   let path = "C:\\Users\\name\\file.txt"
   ```

3. **Common mistakes:**
   ```sigil
   // Wrong: \a is not valid
   let s = "\a"

   // Wrong: \b is not valid
   let s = "\b"

   // Right: use the valid escapes
   let s = "\n\t\r"
   ```
