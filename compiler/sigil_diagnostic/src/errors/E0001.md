# E0001: Unterminated String Literal

A string literal was started but not closed before the end of the line or file.

## Example

```sigil
@main () -> void = run(
    let message = "Hello, world    // Error: string not terminated
    print(msg: message)
)
```

## Explanation

String literals in Sigil must be enclosed in double quotes (`"`). If you start
a string with `"` but don't close it with another `"` before the end of the
line, you'll get this error.

Common causes:
- Forgetting the closing quote
- Accidentally deleting the closing quote during editing
- Using single quotes instead of double quotes (single quotes are for characters)

## Solutions

1. **Add the closing quote:**
   ```sigil
   let message = "Hello, world"
   ```

2. **If you need a multi-line string, use escape sequences:**
   ```sigil
   let message = "Line 1\nLine 2"
   ```

3. **Make sure to use double quotes for strings:**
   ```sigil
   // Wrong: single quotes are for characters
   let c: char = 'a'

   // Right: double quotes for strings
   let s: str = "a"
   ```
