//! Expression type checking helpers.
//!
//! This module contains specialized type checking for different expression types.
//! Most of the work is done in context.rs, but complex cases are delegated here.

// Currently all expression checking is inlined in TypeContext.
// This module is a placeholder for future refactoring when the context gets too large.
