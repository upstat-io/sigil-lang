# Ori Syntax Reference

Load and apply the Ori language syntax reference for the current task.

**Action**: Read `.claude/rules/ori-syntax.md` and use it to assist with:
- Writing correct Ori syntax
- Understanding types, traits, and patterns
- Using prelude functions and methods
- Following Ori formatting conventions

The reference covers: declarations, types, literals, operators, expressions, patterns, imports, FFI, capabilities, and the full prelude.

**Remember**: Ori is expression-based with NO `return` keyword. The last expression in a block IS its value.
