# Update Ori Language Specification

Update the language specification at `docs/ori_lang/0.1-alpha/spec/` to reflect changes just made or follow user instructions.

## Target Directory

```
docs/ori_lang/0.1-alpha/spec/
```

## Writing Style — CRITICAL

The spec is **formal, declarative, authoritative**. Follow the Go Language Specification style.

### DO Write
```markdown
An identifier is a sequence of letters, digits, and underscores.

The type of a binary expression `a + b` is determined by...

It is a compile-time error if the operand types are incompatible.

A function declaration introduces a new binding in the current scope.
```

### DO NOT Write
```markdown
You can use identifiers to name things.

When you write `a + b`, you get back...

Don't use incompatible types or you'll get an error.

Functions let you organize your code into reusable pieces.
```

### Key Rules

1. **No tutorial language** — Never use "you", "we", "let's", "useful for"
2. **Declarative sentences** — State what IS, not how to use it
3. **Technical precision** — Use exact terminology
4. **_Italics_** for technical terms on first use
5. **`Backticks`** for syntax elements
6. **Direct constraints** — "X must be Y", "It is an error if..."

### Normative Keywords

| Term | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| must | Absolute requirement |
| must not | Absolute prohibition |
| shall | Same as must |
| should | Recommendation |
| may | Optional |
| may not | Prohibited |
| error | Compile-time failure |

## Section Structure

```markdown
# Major Section

Brief normative introduction.

> **Grammar:** See [grammar.ebnf](grammar.ebnf) § SECTION_NAME

## Subsection

### Semantics

Normative definitions here.

### Constraints

- It is an error if X.
- Y must satisfy Z.

### Examples

> **Note:** The following examples are informative.

\`\`\`ori
// example code
\`\`\`
```

## Grammar & Rules References

**Do not inline EBNF in spec files.** Reference the formal files:

```markdown
> **Grammar:** See [grammar.ebnf](grammar.ebnf) § SECTION_NAME
> **Rules:** See [operator-rules.md](operator-rules.md) § OPERATOR_NAME
```

Where `SECTION_NAME` matches headers in grammar.ebnf (LEXICAL GRAMMAR, TYPES, DECLARATIONS, EXPRESSIONS, PATTERNS).
Where `OPERATOR_NAME` matches headers in operator-rules.md (Coalesce, Arithmetic, Comparison, etc.).

## Update Process

1. **Identify affected spec files** based on what changed

2. **Read the relevant spec files** to understand current content

3. **Update spec content** following the formal style:
   - Add new sections for new language features
   - Update existing sections for modified behavior
   - Ensure constraints are listed in "Constraints" subsections
   - Mark informative content with `> **Note:**`

4. **Update grammar.ebnf** if syntax changed (or note it needs updating)

5. **Update operator-rules.md** if operator behavior changed (type rules, eval rules, precedence)

6. **Verify cross-references** within spec files are accurate

## Specification vs Design Docs

| Specification (here) | Design (`../design/`) |
|---------------------|----------------------|
| Defines what IS valid Ori | Explains WHY decisions were made |
| Normative, authoritative | Informative, explanatory |
| Formal, precise language | Tutorial tone, best practices |
| "An identifier is..." | "You can use identifiers to..." |

## Checklist

- [ ] Used formal, declarative language (no "you", "we", "let's")
- [ ] Added grammar reference if syntax introduced
- [ ] Marked informative content with `> **Note:**`
- [ ] Listed constraints explicitly
- [ ] Updated cross-references
- [ ] Updated grammar.ebnf if syntax changed
- [ ] Updated operator-rules.md if operator behavior changed

## Output

Report what was updated:
- Which spec files were modified
- Sections added or changed
- Whether grammar.ebnf needs updating
- Whether operator-rules.md needs updating
- Any cross-references updated
