# Clippy configuration for sigilc
#
# Enforce usage of wrapper types instead of raw smart pointers:
# - LocalScope<T> for single-threaded scopes (instead of Rc<RefCell<T>>)
# - Heap<T> for shared heap values (instead of Arc<T>)
#
# Note: These are guidelines, not hard requirements. Use #[expect(clippy::disallowed_types)]
# with a reason comment for intentional uses (e.g., SharedInterner, PatternRegistry).
