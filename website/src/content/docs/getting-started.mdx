## What is Ori?

Ori is a general-purpose, expression-based language with strict static typing, type inference, and mandatory testing. Every function requires tests, every effect is explicit, and the compiler enforces code integrity.

## Install

```bash
curl -fsSL https://ori-lang.com/install.sh | sh
```

## Your First Program

Create a file called `hello.ori`:

```
@main () -> void = print(msg: "Hello, World!")
```

Run it:

```bash
ori run hello.ori
```

## Functions and Testing

Every function in Ori requires tests. Here's a function with its test:

```
@add (a: int, b: int) -> int = a + b

@test_add tests @add () -> void = run(
    assert_eq(actual: add(a: 2, b: 3), expected: 5),
    assert_eq(actual: add(a: -1, b: 1), expected: 0),
)

@main () -> void = run(
    print(msg: "2 + 3 = " + str(add(a: 2, b: 3)))
)
```

## Key Concepts

- **Mandatory testing** — every function needs `@test` blocks or the compiler rejects it
- **Named arguments** — `add(a: 2, b: 3)` not `add(2, 3)`
- **Expression-based** — everything is an expression, no statements
- **No null** — use `Option<T>` for optional values, `Result<T, E>` for errors
- **Explicit effects** — functions declare capabilities like `uses Http`
