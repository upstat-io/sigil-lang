# QR decomposition

**Problem:** Any rectangular m n matrix A can be decomposed to a product of an orthogonal matrix Q and an upper (right) triangular matrix R, as described in QR decomposition. Demonstrate the QR decomposition on the example matrix from the Wikipedia article: 12 & -51 & 4 \\ 6 & 167 & -68 \\ -4 & 24 & -41 and the usage for linear least squares problems on the example from Polynomial regression.

**Requirements:**
- Demonstrate the QR decomposition on the example matrix from the Wikipedia article: 12 & -51 & 4 \\ 6 & 167 & -68 \\ -4 & 24 & -41 and the usage for linear least squares problems on the example from Polynomial regression.

**Success Criteria:**
- Program produces correct output for test cases
- Implementation matches Rosetta Code specification
