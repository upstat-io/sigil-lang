# Natural sorting

**Problem:** Natural sorting is the sorting of text that does more than rely on the order of individual characters codes to make the finding of individual strings easier for a human reader. There is no "one true way" to do this, but for the purpose of this task 'natural' orderings might include: 1. Ignore leading, trailing and multiple adjacent spaces 2. Make all whitespace characters equivalent. 3. Sorting without regard to case. 4. Sorting numeric portions of strings in numeric order.

**Requirements:**
- Implement the first four of the eight given features in a natural sorting routine/function/method...
- For extra credit implement more than the first four.

**Success Criteria:**
- Test each feature implemented separately with an ordered list of test strings from the Sample inputs section below, and make sure your naturally sorted output is in the same order as other language outputs such as Python.
- Print and display your output.
