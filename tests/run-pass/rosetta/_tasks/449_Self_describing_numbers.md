# Self-describing numbers

**Problem:** There are several so-called "self-describing" or "self-descriptive" integers. An integer is said to be "self-describing" if it has the property that, when digit positions are labeled 0 to N-1, the digit in each position is equal to the number of times that that digit appears in the number. For example, 2020 is a four-digit self describing number: Self-describing numbers

**Requirements:**
- position 0 has value 2 and there are two 0s in the number;
- position 1 has value 0 and there are no 1s in the number;
- position 2 has value 2 and there are two 2s;
- position 3 has value 0 and there are zero 3s.

**Success Criteria:**
- Program produces correct output for test cases
- Implementation matches Rosetta Code specification
