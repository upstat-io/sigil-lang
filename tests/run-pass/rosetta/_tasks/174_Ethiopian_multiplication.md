# Ethiopian multiplication

**Problem:** Ethiopian multiplication is a method of multiplying integers using only addition, doubling, and halving. For example: 17 34 Halving the first column: Doubling the second column: Strike-out rows whose first cell is even: Sum the remaining numbers in the right-hand column: So 17 multiplied by 34, by the Ethiopian method is 578. The task is to define three named functions/methods/procedures/subroutines: Use these functions to create a function that does Ethiopian multiplication.

**Requirements:**
- Take two numbers to be multiplied and write them down at the top of two columns.
- Examine the table produced and discard any row where the value in the left column is even.
- one to halve an integer,
- one to double an integer, and
- one to state if an integer is even.

**Success Criteria:**
- In the left-hand column repeatedly halve the last number, discarding any remainders, and write the result below the last in the same column, until you write a value of 1.
- In the right-hand column repeatedly double the last number and write the result below. stop when you add a result in the same row as where the left hand column shows 1.
- Sum the values in the right-hand column that remain to produce the result of multiplying the original two numbers together
