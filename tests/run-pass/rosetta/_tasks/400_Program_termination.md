# Program termination

**Problem:** Show the syntax for a complete stoppage of a program inside a conditional. This includes all threads/processes which are part of your program. Explain the cleanup (or lack thereof) caused by the termination (allocated memory, database connections, open files, object finalizers/destructors, run-on-exit hooks, etc.). Unless otherwise described, no special cleanup outside that provided by the operating system is provided.

**Requirements:**
- Implement the task according to the specification

**Success Criteria:**
- Program produces correct output for test cases
- Implementation matches Rosetta Code specification
