# Nim game

**Problem:** Nim is a simple game where the second player─if they know the trick─will always win. The game has only 3 rules: To win every time, the second player simply takes 4 minus the number the first player took. So if the first player takes 1, the second takes 3; if the first player takes 2, the second should take 2; and if the first player takes 3, the second player will take 1. Design a simple Nim game where the human player goes first, and the computer always wins. The game should enforce the rules.

**Requirements:**
- start with 12 tokens
- each player takes 1, 2, or 3 tokens in turn
- the player who takes the last token wins.

**Success Criteria:**
- Program produces correct output for test cases
- Implementation matches Rosetta Code specification
