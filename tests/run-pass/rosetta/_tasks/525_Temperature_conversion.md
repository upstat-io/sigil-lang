# Temperature conversion

**Problem:** There are quite a number of temperature scales. For this task we will concentrate on four of the perhaps best-known ones: Kelvin, Celsius, Fahrenheit, and Rankine. The Celsius and Kelvin scales have the same magnitude, but different null points. 0 degrees Celsius corresponds to 273.15 kelvin. 0 kelvin is absolute zero. The Fahrenheit and Rankine scales also have the same magnitude, but different null points. 0 degrees Fahrenheit corresponds to 459.67 degrees Rankine.

**Requirements:**
- Implement the task according to the specification

**Success Criteria:**
- Program produces correct output for test cases
- Implementation matches Rosetta Code specification
