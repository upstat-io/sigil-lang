# Least common multiple

**Problem:** Compute the least common multiple (LCM) of two integers. Given m and n, the least common multiple is the smallest positive integer that has both m and n as factors. The least common multiple of 12 and 18 is 36, because: As a special case, if either m or n is zero, then the least common multiple is zero. One way to calculate the least common multiple is to iterate all the multiples of m, until you find one that is also a multiple of n.

**Requirements:**
- 12 is a factor (12 3 = 36), and
- 18 is a factor (18 2 = 36), and
- there is no positive integer less than 36 that has both factors.
- greatest common divisor.
- MathWorld entry: Least Common Multiple.

**Success Criteria:**
- Program produces correct output for test cases
- Implementation matches Rosetta Code specification
