# De Bruijn sequences

**Problem:** The sequences are named after the Dutch mathematician Nicolaas Govert de Bruijn. A note on Dutch capitalization: Nicolaas' last name is de Bruijn, the de isn't normally capitalized unless it's the first word in a sentence. Rosetta Code (more or less by default or by fiat) requires the first word in the task name to be capitalized.

**Requirements:**
- In combinatorial mathematics, a de Bruijn sequence of order n on
- a size-k alphabet (computer science) A is a cyclic sequence in which every
- possible length-n string (computer science, formal theory) on A occurs
- exactly once as a contiguous substring.
- Such a sequence is denoted by B(k, n) and has
- length kn, which is also the number of distinct substrings of
- length n on A
- de Bruijn sequences are therefore optimally short.

**Success Criteria:**
- Task completed according to Rosetta Code specification
