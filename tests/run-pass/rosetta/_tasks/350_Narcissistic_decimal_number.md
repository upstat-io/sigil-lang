# Narcissistic decimal number

**Problem:** A Narcissistic decimal number is a non-negative integer, n, that is equal to the sum of the m-th powers of each of the digits in the decimal representation of n, where m is the number of digits in the decimal representation of n. Narcissistic (decimal) numbers are sometimes called Armstrong numbers, named after Michael F. Armstrong. They are also known as Plus Perfect numbers. An example: Generate and show here the first 25 narcissistic decimal numbers. Note: 0^1 = 0, the first in the series.

**Requirements:**
- if n is 153
- then m, (the number of decimal digits) is 3
- we have 13 + 53 + 33 = 1 + 125 + 27 = 153
- and so 153 is a narcissistic decimal number
- the OEIS entry: Armstrong (or Plus Perfect, or narcissistic) numbers.
- MathWorld entry: Narcissistic Number.

**Success Criteria:**
- Program produces correct output for test cases
- Implementation matches Rosetta Code specification
