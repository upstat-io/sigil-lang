# Power set

**Problem:** A set is a collection (container) of certain values, without any particular order, and no repeated values. It corresponds with a finite set in mathematics. A set can be implemented as an associative array (partial mapping) in which the value of each key-value pair is ignored. Given a set S, the power set (or powerset) of S, written P(S), or 2S, is the set of all subsets of S.

**Requirements:**
- A set can be implemented as an associative array (partial mapping) in which the value of each key-value pair is ignored.

**Success Criteria:**
- Program produces correct output for test cases
- Implementation matches Rosetta Code specification
