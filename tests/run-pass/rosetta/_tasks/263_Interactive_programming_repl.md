# Interactive programming (repl)

**Problem:** Many language implementations come with an interactive mode. This is a command-line interpreter that reads lines from the user and evaluates these lines as statements or expressions. An interactive mode may also be known as a command mode, a read-eval-print loop (REPL), or a shell. Show how to start this mode.

**Requirements:**
- Show how to start this mode.

**Success Criteria:**
- Program produces correct output for test cases
- Implementation matches Rosetta Code specification
