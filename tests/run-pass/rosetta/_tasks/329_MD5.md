# MD5

**Problem:** Encode a string using an MD5 algorithm. The algorithm can be found on Wikipedia. Optionally, validate your implementation by running all of the test values in IETF RFC (1321) for MD5. Additionally, RFC 1321 provides more precise information on the algorithm than the Wikipedia article. If the solution on this page is a library solution, see MD5/Implementation for an implementation from scratch.

**Requirements:**
- Optionally, validate your implementation by running all of the test values in IETF RFC (1321) for MD5.
- If the solution on this page is a library solution, see MD5/Implementation for an implementation from scratch.

**Success Criteria:**
- Program produces correct output for test cases
- Implementation matches Rosetta Code specification
