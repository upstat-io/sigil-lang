# Stern-Brocot sequence

**Problem:** For this task, the Stern-Brocot sequence is to be generated by an algorithm similar to that employed in generating the Fibonacci sequence. The task is to: Show your output on this page. Related tasks:

**Requirements:**
- The first and second members of the sequence are both 1:
- Start by considering the second member of the sequence
- Sum the considered member of the sequence and its precedent, (1 + 1) = 2, and append it to the end of the sequence:
- 1, 1, 2
- Append the considered member of the sequence to the end of the sequence:
- 1, 1, 2, 1
- Consider the next member of the series, (the third member i.e. 2)
- GOTO 3
- ─── Expanding another loop we get: ───
- Sum the considered member of the sequence and its precedent, (2 + 1) = 3, and append it to the end of the sequence:

**Success Criteria:**
- Show the first fifteen members of the sequence. (This should be: 1, 1, 2, 1, 3, 2, 3, 1, 4, 3, 5, 2, 5, 3, 4)
