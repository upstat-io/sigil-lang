# Dining philosophers

**Problem:** The dining philosophers problem illustrates non-composability of low-level synchronization primitives like semaphores. It is a modification of a problem posed by Edsger Dijkstra. Five philosophers, Aristotle, Kant, Spinoza, Marx, and Russell (the tasks) spend their time thinking and eating spaghetti. They eat at a round table with five individual seats.

**Requirements:**
- There are many solutions of the problem, program at least one, and explain how the deadlock is prevented.

**Success Criteria:**
- Task completed according to Rosetta Code specification
