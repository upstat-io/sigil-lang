# Split a character string based on change of character

**Problem:** Split a (character) string into comma (plus a blank) delimited strings based on a change of character (left to right). Show the output here (use the 1st example below). Blanks should be treated as any other character (except they are problematic to display clearly). The same applies For instance, the string: gHHH5YY++///\ should be split and show: g, HHH, 5, YY, ++, ///, \

**Requirements:**
- Show the output here (use the 1st example below).
- Blanks should be treated as any other character (except they are problematic to display clearly).
- The same applies For instance, the string: gHHH5YY++///\ should be split and show: g, HHH, 5, YY, ++, ///, \

**Success Criteria:**
- Program produces correct output for test cases
- Implementation matches Rosetta Code specification
