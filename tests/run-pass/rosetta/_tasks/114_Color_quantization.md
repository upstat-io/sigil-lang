# Color quantization

**Problem:** Color quantization is the process of reducing number of colors used in an image while trying to maintain the visual appearance of the original image. In general, it is a form of cluster analysis, if each RGB color value is considered as a coordinate triple in the 3D colorspace. There are some well know algorithms [1], each with its own advantages and drawbacks.

**Requirements:**
- Note: the funny color bar on top of the frog image is intentional.

**Success Criteria:**
- Task completed according to Rosetta Code specification
