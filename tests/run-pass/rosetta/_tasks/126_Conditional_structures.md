# Conditional structures

**Problem:** List the conditional structures offered by a programming language. See Wikipedia: conditionals for descriptions. Common conditional structures include if-then-else and switch. Less common are arithmetic if, ternary operator and Hash-based conditionals. Arithmetic if allows tight control over computed gotos, which optimizers have a hard time to figure out.

**Requirements:**
- Implement the task according to the specification

**Success Criteria:**
- Program produces correct output for test cases
- Implementation matches Rosetta Code specification
