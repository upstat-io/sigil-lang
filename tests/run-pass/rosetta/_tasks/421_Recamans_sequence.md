# Recaman's sequence

**Problem:** The Recamán's sequence generates Natural numbers. Starting from a(0)=0, the n'th term a(n), where n>0, is the previous term minus n i.e a(n) = a(n-1) - n but only if this is both positive and has not been previously generated. If the conditions don't hold then a(n) = a(n-1) + n. References:

**Requirements:**
- Generate and show here the first 15 members of the sequence.
- Find and show here, the first duplicated number in the sequence.
- Optionally: Find and show here, how many terms of the sequence are needed until all the integers 0..1000, inclusive, are generated.

**Success Criteria:**
- Program produces correct output for test cases
- Implementation matches Rosetta Code specification
