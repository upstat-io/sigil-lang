# Priority queue

**Problem:** A priority queue is somewhat similar to a queue, with an important distinction: each item is added to a priority queue with a priority level, and will be later removed from the queue with the highest priority element first. That is, the items are (conceptually) stored in the queue in priority order instead of in insertion order. Create a priority queue.

**Requirements:**
- Insertion. An element is added to the queue with a priority (a numeric value).

**Success Criteria:**
- Top item removal. Deletes the element or one of the elements with the current top priority and return it.
