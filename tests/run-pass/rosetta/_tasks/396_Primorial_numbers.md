# Primorial numbers

**Problem:** Primorial numbers are those formed by multiplying successive prime numbers. The primorial number series is: To express this mathematically, primorialn is the product of the first n (successive) primes: primorial_n = _{k=1}^n prime_k ─── where prime_k is the kth prime number. In some sense, generating primorial numbers is similar to factorials. As with factorials, primorial numbers get large quickly. By length (above), it is meant the number of decimal digits in the numbers. Related tasks:
