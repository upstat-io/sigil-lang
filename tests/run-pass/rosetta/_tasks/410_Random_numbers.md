# Random numbers

**Problem:** Generate a collection filled with 1000 normally distributed random (or pseudo-random) numbers with a mean of 1.0 and a standard deviation of 0.5 Many libraries only generate uniformly distributed random numbers. If so, you may use one of these algorithms.

**Requirements:**
- Standard deviation

**Success Criteria:**
- Program produces correct output for test cases
- Implementation matches Rosetta Code specification
