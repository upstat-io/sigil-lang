# Ternary logic

**Problem:** In logic, a three-valued logic (also trivalent, ternary, or trinary logic, sometimes abbreviated 3VL) is any of several many-valued logic systems in which there are three truth values indicating true, false and some indeterminate third value. This is contrasted with the more commonly known bivalent logics (such as classical sentential or boolean logic) which provide only for true and false. Conceptual form and basic ideas were initially created by Łukasiewicz, Lewis and Sulski.

**Requirements:**
- Define a new type that emulates ternary logic by storing data trits.
- Given all the binary logic operators of the original programming language, reimplement these operators for the new Ternary logic type trit.
- Kudos for actually thinking up a test case algorithm where ternary logic is intrinsically useful, optimises the test case algorithm and is preferable to binary logic.

**Success Criteria:**
- Generate a sampling of results using trit variables.
