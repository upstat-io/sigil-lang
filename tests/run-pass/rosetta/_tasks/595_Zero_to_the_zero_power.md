# Zero to the zero power

**Problem:** Some computer programming languages are not exactly consistent (with other computer programming languages) when raising zero to the zeroth power: 00 Show the results of raising zero to the zeroth power. If your computer language objects to 0**0 or 0^0 at compile time, you may also try something like: Show the result here. And of course use any symbols or notation that is supported in your computer programming language for exponentiation.

**Requirements:**
- The Wiki entry: Zero to the power of zero.
- The Wiki entry: Zero to the power of zero: History.
- The MathWorld™ entry: exponent laws.
- Also, in the above MathWorld™ entry, see formula (9): x^0=1.
- The OEIS entry: The special case of zero to the zeroth power

**Success Criteria:**
- Program produces correct output for test cases
- Implementation matches Rosetta Code specification
