# Run-length encoding

**Problem:** Given a string containing uppercase characters (A-Z), compress repeated 'runs' of the same character by storing the length of that run, and provide a function to reverse the compression. The output can be anything, as long as you can recreate the input with it. Input: WWWWWWWWWWWWBWWWWWWWWWWWWBBBWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWBWWWWWWWWWWWWWW Output: 12W1B12W3B24W1B14W Note: the encoding step in the above example is the same as a step of the Look-and-say sequence.

**Requirements:**
- The output can be anything, as long as you can recreate the input with it.

**Success Criteria:**
- Program produces correct output for test cases
- Implementation matches Rosetta Code specification
