# Bitwise operations

**Problem:** Perform bitwise operations on integers.

**Requirements:**
- Logical operations on two integers: AND, OR, XOR
- Unary NOT on first integer
- Shift operations: left shift, right shift (logical), right arithmetic shift
- Rotate operations: left rotate, right rotate
- Use second integer as shift/rotate amount
- Document any unavailable operations

**Success Criteria:**
- All operations produce correct bitwise results
- Shifts and rotates work for arbitrary bit counts
