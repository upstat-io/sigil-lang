# Jensen's Device

**Problem:** This task is an exercise in call by name. Jensen's Device is a computer programming technique devised by Danish computer scientist Jørn Jensen after studying the ALGOL 60 Report. The following program was proposed to illustrate the technique. It computes the 100th harmonic number: real procedure sum (i, lo, hi, term); value lo, hi; integer i, lo, hi; comment term is passed by-name, and so is i; for i := lo step 1 until hi do temp := temp + term; sum := temp comment note the correspondence betwee

**Requirements:**
- Implement the task according to the specification

**Success Criteria:**
- Program produces correct output for test cases
- Implementation matches Rosetta Code specification
