# Parallel calculations

**Problem:** Many programming languages allow you to specify computations to be run in parallel. While Concurrent computing is focused on concurrency, the purpose of this task is to distribute time-consuming calculations on as many CPUs as possible. Assume we have a collection of numbers, and want to find the one with the largest minimal prime factor (that is, the one that contains relatively large factors).

**Requirements:**
- Implement the task according to the specification

**Success Criteria:**
- Program produces correct output for test cases
- Implementation matches Rosetta Code specification
