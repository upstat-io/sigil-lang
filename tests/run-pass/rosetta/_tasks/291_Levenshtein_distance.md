# Levenshtein distance

**Problem:** In information theory and computer science, the Levenshtein distance is a metric for measuring the amount of difference between two sequences (i.e. an edit distance). The Levenshtein distance between two strings is defined as the minimum number of edits needed to transform one string into the other, with the allowable edit operations being insertion, deletion, or substitution of a single character.

**Requirements:**
- sittin sitting (insert 'g' at the end).
- Longest common subsequence

**Success Criteria:**
- Program produces correct output for test cases
- Implementation matches Rosetta Code specification
