# Classes

**Problem:** In object-oriented programming class is a set (a transitive closure) of types bound by the relation of inheritance. It is said that all types derived from some base type T and the type T itself form a class T. The first type T from the class T sometimes is called the root type of the class. A class of types itself, as a type, has the values and operations of its own. The operations of are usually called methods of the root type. Both operations and values are called polymorphic.

**Requirements:**
- Implement the task according to the specification

**Success Criteria:**
- single-dispatch languages are those that allow only one argument or result to control the dispatch. Usually it is the first parameter, often hidden, so that a prefix notation x.f() is used instead of mathematical f(x).
- multiple-dispatch languages allow many arguments and/or results to control the dispatch.
