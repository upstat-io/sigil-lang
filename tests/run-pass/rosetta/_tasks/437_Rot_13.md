# Rot-13

**Problem:** Implement a rot-13 function (or procedure, class, subroutine, or other "callable" object as appropriate to your programming environment). Optionally wrap this function in a utility program (like tr, which acts like a common UNIX utility, performing a line-by-line rot-13 encoding of every line of input contained in each file listed on its command line, or (if no filenames are passed thereon) acting as a filter on its "standard input.

**Requirements:**
- Caesar cipher
- Substitution Cipher
- Vigenère Cipher/Cryptanalysis

**Success Criteria:**
- Program produces correct output for test cases
- Implementation matches Rosetta Code specification
