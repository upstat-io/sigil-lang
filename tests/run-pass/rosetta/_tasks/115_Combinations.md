# Combinations

**Problem:** Given non-negative integers m and n, generate all size m combinations of the integers from 0 (zero) to n-1 in sorted order (each combination is sorted and the entire table is sorted). 3 comb 5 is: If it is more "natural" in your language to start counting from 1 (unity) instead of 0 (zero), the combinations can be of the integers from 1 to n.

**Requirements:**
- Implement the task according to the specification

**Success Criteria:**
- Program produces correct output for test cases
- Implementation matches Rosetta Code specification
