# Sorting algorithms/Insertion sort

**Problem:** An O(n2) sorting algorithm which moves elements one at a time into the correct position. The algorithm consists of inserting one element at a time into the previously sorted part of the array, moving higher ranked elements up as necessary. To start off, the first (or smallest, or any arbitrary) element of the unsorted array is considered to be the sorted part.

**Requirements:**
- small n,
- as the final finishing-off algorithm for O(n logn) algorithms such as mergesort and quicksort.

**Success Criteria:**
- Program produces correct output for test cases
- Implementation matches Rosetta Code specification
