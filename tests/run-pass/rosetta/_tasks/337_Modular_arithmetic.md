# Modular arithmetic

**Problem:** Modular arithmetic is a form of arithmetic (a calculation technique involving the concepts of addition and multiplication) which is done on numbers with a defined equivalence relation called congruence. For any positive integer m called the congruence modulus, two numbers a and b are said to be congruent modulo m whenever there exists an integer k such that: a = b + k\,m The corresponding set of equivalence classes forms a ring denoted \Z/m\Z.

**Requirements:**
- Implement the task according to the specification

**Success Criteria:**
- Program produces correct output for test cases
- Implementation matches Rosetta Code specification
