# Loops/Break

**Problem:** Show a loop which prints random numbers (each number newly generated each loop) from 0 to 19 (inclusive). If a number is 10, stop the loop after printing it, and do not generate any further numbers. Otherwise, generate and print a second random number before restarting the loop. If the number 10 is never generated as the first number in a loop, loop forever. Related tasks:
