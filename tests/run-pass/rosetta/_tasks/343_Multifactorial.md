# Multifactorial

**Problem:** The factorial of a number, written as n!, is defined as n! = n(n-1)(n-2)...(2)(1). Multifactorials generalize factorials as follows: n! = n(n-1)(n-2)...(2)(1) n!! = n(n-2)(n-4)... n!! ! = n(n-3)(n-6)... n!! !! = n(n-4)(n-8)... n!! !! ! = n(n-5)(n-10)... In all cases, the terms in the products are positive integers.

**Requirements:**
- Write a function that given n and the degree, calculates the multifactorial.
- Use the function to generate and display here a table of the first ten members (1 to 10) of the first five degrees of multifactorial.

**Success Criteria:**
- Program produces correct output for test cases
- Implementation matches Rosetta Code specification
