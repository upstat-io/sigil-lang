# Pythagorean triples

**Problem:** A Pythagorean triple is defined as three positive integers (a, b, c) where a , and a^2+b^2=c^2. They are called primitive triples if a, b, c are co-prime, that is, if their pairwise greatest common divisors { gcd}(a, b) = { gcd}(a, c) = { gcd}(b, c) = 1. Because of their relationship through the Pythagorean theorem, a, b, and c are co-prime if a and b are co-prime ({ gcd}(a, b) = 1). Each triple forms the length of the sides of a right triangle, whose perimeter is P=a+b+c.
