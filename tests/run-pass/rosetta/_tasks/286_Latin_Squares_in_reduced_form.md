# Latin Squares in reduced form

**Problem:** A Latin Square is in its reduced form if the first row and first column contain items in their natural order. The order n is the number of items. For any given n there is a set of reduced Latin Squares whose size increases rapidly with n. g is a number which identifies a unique element within the set of reduced Latin Squares of order n.

**Requirements:**
- displaying the four reduced Latin Squares of order 4.
- for n = 1 to 6 (or more) produce the set of reduced Latin Squares; produce a table which shows the size of the set of reduced Latin Squares and compares this value times n! times (n-1)! with the values in OEIS A002860.

**Success Criteria:**
- Program produces correct output for test cases
- Implementation matches Rosetta Code specification
