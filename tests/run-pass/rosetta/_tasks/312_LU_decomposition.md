# LU decomposition

**Problem:** Every square matrix A can be decomposed into a product of a lower triangular matrix L and a upper triangular matrix U, as described in LU decomposition. It is a modified form of Gaussian elimination. While the Cholesky decomposition only works for symmetric, positive definite matrices, the more general LU decomposition works for any square matrix. There are several algorithms for calculating L and U.

**Requirements:**
- Implement the task according to the specification

**Success Criteria:**
- Program produces correct output for test cases
- Implementation matches Rosetta Code specification
