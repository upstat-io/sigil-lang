# Nested function

**Problem:** In many languages, functions can be nested, resulting in outer functions and inner functions. The inner function can access variables from the outer function. In most languages, the inner function can also modify variables in the outer function. Write a program consisting of two nested functions that prints the following text. The outer function (called MakeList or equivalent) is responsible for creating the list as a whole and is given the separator ". " as argument.

**Requirements:**
- Nested function

**Success Criteria:**
- Program produces correct output for test cases
- Implementation matches Rosetta Code specification
