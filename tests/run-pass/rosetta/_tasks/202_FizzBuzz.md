# FizzBuzz

**Problem:** Write a program that prints the integers from 1 to 100 (inclusive). The FizzBuzz problem was presented as the lowest level of comprehension required to illustrate adequacy.

**Requirements:**
- for multiples of three, print Fizz instead of the number;
- for multiples of five, print Buzz instead of the number;
- for multiples of both three and five, print FizzBuzz instead of the number.

**Success Criteria:**
- Program produces correct output for test cases
- Implementation matches Rosetta Code specification
