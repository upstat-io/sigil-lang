# Gray code

**Problem:** Gray code is a form of binary encoding where transitions between consecutive numbers differ by only one bit. This is a useful encoding for reducing hardware data hazards with values that change rapidly and/or connect to slower hardware as inputs. It is also useful for generating inputs for Karnaugh maps in order from left to right or top to bottom. Create functions to encode a number to and decode a number from Gray code.

**Requirements:**
- Converting Between Gray and Binary Codes. It includes step-by-step animations.

**Success Criteria:**
- Program produces correct output for test cases
- Implementation matches Rosetta Code specification
