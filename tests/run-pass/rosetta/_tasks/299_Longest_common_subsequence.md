# Longest common subsequence

**Problem:** Introduction Define a subsequence to be any output string obtained by deleting zero or more symbols from an input string. The Longest Common Subsequence (LCS) is a subsequence of maximum length common to two or more strings. Let A A[0] A[m - 1] and B B[0] B[n - 1], m n be strings drawn from an alphabet &Sigma; of size s, containing every distinct symbol in A + B. An ordered pair (i, j) will be referred to as a match if A[i] = B[j], where 0 i m and 0 j n.

**Requirements:**
- Implement the task according to the specification

**Success Criteria:**
- Program produces correct output for test cases
- Implementation matches Rosetta Code specification
