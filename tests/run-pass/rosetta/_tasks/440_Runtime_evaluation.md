**Problem:** Demonstrate a language's ability for programs to execute code written in the language provided at runtime. Show what kind of program fragments are permitted (e.g. expressions vs. statements), and how to get values in and out (e.g. environments, arguments, return values), if applicable what lexical/static environment the program is evaluated in, and what facilities for restricting (e.g. sandboxes, resource limits) or customizing (e.g. debugging facilities) the execution.

**Requirements:**
- Show what kind of program fragments are permitted (e.g.

**Success Criteria:**
- Program produces correct output for test cases
- Implementation matches Rosetta Code specification
