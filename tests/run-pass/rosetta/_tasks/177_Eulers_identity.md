# Euler's identity

**Problem:** In mathematics, Euler's identity is the equality: e is Euler's number, the base of natural logarithms, i is the imaginary unit, which satisfies i2 = −1, and is pi, the ratio of the circumference of a circle to its diameter. Euler's identity is often cited as an example of deep mathematical beauty. Three of the basic arithmetic operations occur exactly once each: addition, multiplication, and exponentiation. The identity also links five fundamental mathematical constants: The number 0.
