**Problem:** A word search puzzle typically consists of a grid of letters in which words are hidden. There are many varieties of word search puzzles. For the task at hand we will use a rectangular grid in which the words may be placed horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. The words may also be spelled backwards. The words may overlap but are not allowed to zigzag, or wrap around. Create a 10 by 10 word search and fill it using words from the unixdict.
