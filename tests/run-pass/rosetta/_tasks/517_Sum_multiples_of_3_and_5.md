# Sum multiples of 3 and 5

**Problem:** The objective is to write a function that finds the sum of all positive multiples of 3 or 5 below n. Show output for n = 1000. This is is the same as Project Euler problem 1. Extra credit: do this efficiently for n = 1e20 or higher.

**Requirements:**
- Show output for n = 1000.

**Success Criteria:**
- Program produces correct output for test cases
- Implementation matches Rosetta Code specification
