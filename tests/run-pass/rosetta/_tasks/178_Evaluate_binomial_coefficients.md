# Evaluate binomial coefficients

**Problem:** This programming task, is to calculate ANY binomial coefficient. However, it has to be able to output {3}, which is 10. This formula is recommended: {k} = {(n-k)!k!} = {k(k-1)(k-2) 1}

**Requirements:**
- Combinations and permutations
- Pascal's triangle

**Success Criteria:**
- Program produces correct output for test cases
- Implementation matches Rosetta Code specification
