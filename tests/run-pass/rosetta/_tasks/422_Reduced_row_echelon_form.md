# Reduced row echelon form

**Problem:** Show how to compute the reduced row echelon form (a.k.a. row canonical form) of a matrix. The matrix can be stored in any datatype that is convenient (for most languages, this will probably be a two-dimensional array). Built-in functions or this pseudocode (from Wikipedia) may be used: function ToReducedRowEchelonForm(Matrix M) is rowCount := the number of rows in M columnCount := the number of columns in M

**Requirements:**
- Implement the task according to the specification

**Success Criteria:**
- Program produces correct output for test cases
- Implementation matches Rosetta Code specification
