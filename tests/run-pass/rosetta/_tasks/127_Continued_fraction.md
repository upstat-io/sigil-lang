# Continued fraction

**Problem:** A number may be represented as a continued fraction (see Mathworld for more information) as follows: a 0 + b 1 a 1 + b 2 a 2 + b 3 a 3 + ⋱ +{ {a+{ {a+{ }}}}}}} The task is to write a program which generates such a number and prints a real representation of it.

**Requirements:**
- The code should be tested by calculating and printing the square root of 2, Napier's Constant, and Pi, using the following coefficients:
- For the square root of 2, use
- }=1+{ {2+{ {2+{ }}}}}}}
- For Napier's Constant, use
- {1+{ {2+{ {3+{ }}}}}}}}}
- For Pi, use
- {6+{ {6+{ }}}}}}}
- Continued fraction/Arithmetic for tasks that do arithmetic over continued fractions.

**Success Criteria:**
- Task completed according to Rosetta Code specification
