# Loops/Foreach

**Problem:** Loop through and print each element in a collection in order. Use your language's "for each" loop if it has one, otherwise iterate through the collection in order with some other loop. Related tasks:

**Requirements:**
- Loop over multiple arrays simultaneously
- Loops/Break
- Loops/Continue
- Loops/Do-while
- Loops/Downward for
- Loops/For
- Loops/For with a specified step
- Loops/Foreach
- Loops/Increment loop index within loop body
- Loops/Infinite

**Success Criteria:**
- Program produces correct output for test cases
- Implementation matches Rosetta Code specification
