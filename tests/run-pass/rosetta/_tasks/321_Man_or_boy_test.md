# Man or boy test

**Problem:** Background: The man or boy test was proposed by computer scientist Donald Knuth as a means of evaluating implementations of the ALGOL 60 programming language. The aim of the test was to distinguish compilers that correctly implemented "recursion and non-local references" from those that did not.

**Requirements:**
- Jensen's Device

**Success Criteria:**
- Program produces correct output for test cases
- Implementation matches Rosetta Code specification
