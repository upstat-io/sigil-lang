# Floyd-Warshall algorithm

**Problem:** The Floyd–Warshall algorithm is an algorithm for finding shortest paths in a weighted graph with positive or negative edge weights. Find the lengths of the shortest paths between all pairs of vertices of the given directed graph. Your code may assume that the input has already been checked for loops, parallel edges and negative cycles. Print the pair, the distance and (optionally) the path.

**Requirements:**
- Floyd-Warshall Algorithm - step by step guide (youtube)

**Success Criteria:**
- Program produces correct output for test cases
- Implementation matches Rosetta Code specification
