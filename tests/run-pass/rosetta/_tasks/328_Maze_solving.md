# Maze solving

**Problem:** For a maze generated by this task, write a function that finds (and displays) the shortest path between two cells. Note that because these mazes are generated by the Depth-first search algorithm, they contain no circular paths, and a simple depth-first tree search can be used.

**Requirements:**
- Implement the task according to the specification

**Success Criteria:**
- Program produces correct output for test cases
- Implementation matches Rosetta Code specification
