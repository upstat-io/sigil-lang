# Set

**Problem:** A set is a collection of elements, without duplicates and without order. Show each of these set operations: As an option, show some other set operations. (If A B, but A B, then A is called a true or proper subset of B, written A B or A &#x228a; B.) As another option, show how to modify a mutable set. One might implement a set using an associative array (with set elements as array keys and some dummy value as the values).

**Requirements:**
- Set creation
- Test m S -- "m is an element in set S"
- A B -- union; a set of all elements either in set A or in set B.
- A B -- intersection; a set of all elements in both set A and set B.
- A &#x2216; B -- difference; a set of all elements in set A, except those in set B.
- A B -- subset; true if every element in set A is also in set B.
- A = B -- equality; true if every element of set A is in set B and vice versa.

**Success Criteria:**
- Program produces correct output for test cases
- Implementation matches Rosetta Code specification
