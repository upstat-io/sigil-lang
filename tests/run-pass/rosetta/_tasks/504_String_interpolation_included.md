# String interpolation (included)

**Problem:** Given a string and defined variables or values, string interpolation is the replacement of defined character sequences in the string by values or variable values. For example, given an original string of "Mary had a X lamb.", a value of "big", and if the language replaces X in its interpolation routine, then the result of its interpolation would be the string "Mary had a big lamb".

**Requirements:**
- If possible, give links to further documentation on your languages string interpolation features.

**Success Criteria:**
- Use your languages inbuilt string interpolation abilities to interpolate a string missing the text "little" which is held in a variable, to produce the output string "Mary had a little lamb".
