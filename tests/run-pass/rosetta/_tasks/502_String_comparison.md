# String comparison

**Problem:** Demonstrate how to compare two strings from within the language and how to achieve a lexical comparison. The task should demonstrate: For example, you might demonstrate the difference between generic/polymorphic comparison and coercive/allomorphic comparison if your language supports such a distinction.

**Requirements:**
- Comparing two strings for exact equality
- Comparing two strings for inequality (i.e., the inverse of exact equality)
- Comparing two strings to see if one is lexically ordered before than the other
- Comparing two strings to see if one is lexically ordered after than the other
- How to achieve both case sensitive comparisons and case insensitive comparisons within the language
- How the language handles comparison of numeric strings if these are not treated lexically
- Demonstrate any other kinds of string comparisons that the language provides, particularly as it relates to your type system.

**Success Criteria:**
- Program produces correct output for test cases
- Implementation matches Rosetta Code specification
