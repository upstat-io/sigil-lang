# Vampire number

**Problem:** A vampire number is a natural decimal number with an even number of digits, that can be factored into two integers. These two factors are called the fangs, and must have the following properties: An example of a vampire number and its fangs: 1260 : (21, 60) 16758243290880, 24959017348650, 14593825548650 Note that a vampire number can have more than one pair of fangs.

**Requirements:**
- they each contain half the number of the decimal digits of the original number
- together they consist of exactly the same decimal digits as the original number
- at most one of them has a trailing zero
- Print the first 25 vampire numbers and their fangs.
- Check if the following numbers are vampire numbers and, if so, print them and their fangs:
