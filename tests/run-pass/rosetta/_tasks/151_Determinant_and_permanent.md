# Determinant and permanent

**Problem:** For a given matrix, return the determinant and the permanent of the matrix. For a matrix of orthonormal basis vectors, return the Levi-Civita symbol of the orthonormal basis vector permutation. The determinant is given by det ( A ) = ∑ σ sgn ⁡ ( σ ) ∏ i = 1 n M i , σ i ( ) M}}} while the permanent is given by perm ⁡ ( A ) = ∑ σ ∏ i = 1 n M i , σ i (A)= M}}} In both cases the sum is over the permutations σ } of the permutations of 1, 2, ..., n.

**Requirements:**
- (A permutation's sign is 1 if there are an even number of inversions and -1 otherwise
- see parity of a permutation.)
- Complexity of known algorithms
- Laplace expansion
- Leibniz fomula
- Bareiss algorithm
- LU-decomposition
- Strassen algorithm

**Success Criteria:**
- Task completed according to Rosetta Code specification
