# Functional coverage tree

**Problem:** Functional coverage is a measure of how much a particular function of a system has been verified as correct. It is used heavily in tracking the completeness of the verification of complex System on Chip (SoC) integrated circuits, where it can also be used to track how well the functional requirements of the system have been verified. This task uses a sub-set of the calculations sometimes used in tracking functional coverage but uses a more familiar(?) scenario.

**Requirements:**
- It is used heavily in tracking the completeness of the verification of complex System on Chip (SoC) integrated circuits, where it can also be used to track how well the functional requirements of the system have been verified.

**Success Criteria:**
- Program produces correct output for test cases
- Implementation matches Rosetta Code specification
