# Sieve of Eratosthenes

**Problem:** The Sieve of Eratosthenes is a simple algorithm that finds the prime numbers up to a given integer. Implement the Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm, with the only allowed optimization that the outer loop can stop at the square root of the limit, and the inner loop may start at the square of the prime just found. That means especially that you shouldn't optimize by using pre-computed wheels, i.e.

**Requirements:**
- It is important that the sieve algorithm be the actual algorithm used to find prime numbers for the task.
- Emirp primes
- count in factors
- prime decomposition
- factors of an integer
- extensible prime generator
- primality by trial division
- factors of a Mersenne number
- trial factoring of a Mersenne number
- partition an integer X into N primes

**Success Criteria:**
- Program produces correct output for test cases
- Implementation matches Rosetta Code specification
