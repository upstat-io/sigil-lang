# Truth table

**Problem:** A truth table is a display of the inputs to, and the output of a Boolean function organized as a table where each row gives one combination of input values and the corresponding value of the function. Related tasks:

**Requirements:**
- Input a Boolean function from the user as a string then calculate and print a formatted truth table for the given function. (One can assume that the user input is correct).
- Either reverse-polish or infix notation expressions are allowed.
- Boolean values
- Ternary logic
- Wolfram MathWorld entry on truth tables.
- some "truth table" examples from Google.

**Success Criteria:**
- Print and show output for Boolean functions of two and three input variables, but any program should not be limited to that many variables in the function.
