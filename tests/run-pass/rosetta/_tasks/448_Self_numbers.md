# Self numbers

**Problem:** A number n is a self number if there is no number g such that g + the sum of g's digits = n. So 18 is not a self number because 9+9=18, 43 is not a self number because 35+5+3=43. The task is: Display the first 50 self numbers; I believe that the 100000000th self number is 1022727208. You should either confirm or dispute my conjecture. 224036583-1 is a Mersenne prime, claimed to also be a self number. Extra credit to anyone proving it.

**Requirements:**
- The task is: Display the first 50 self numbers; I believe that the 100000000th self number is 1022727208.
- You should either confirm or dispute my conjecture.

**Success Criteria:**
- Program produces correct output for test cases
- Implementation matches Rosetta Code specification
