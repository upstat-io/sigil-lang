# Amb

**Problem:** Implement the Amb (ambiguous) operator for nondeterministic choice with backtracking.

**Behavior:**
- `amb()` with no args fails
- `amb(v1, v2, ...)` explores all possibilities
- Backtracks when constraints fail, succeeds when all constraints met

**Test Case:** Select one word from each set where last char of each word equals first char of next:
- Set 1: "the", "that", "a"
- Set 2: "frog", "elephant", "thing"
- Set 3: "walked", "treaded", "grows"
- Set 4: "slowly", "quickly"

**Success Criteria:**
- Output: "that thing grows slowly"
- Must use actual backtracking, not just nested loops
