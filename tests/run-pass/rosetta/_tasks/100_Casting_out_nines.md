# Casting out nines

**Problem:** Task (in three parts) Part 1 Write a procedure (say c o 9 ( x ) }(x)}} ) which implements Casting Out Nines as described by returning the checksum for x } .

**Requirements:**
- Demonstrate the procedure using the examples given there, or others you may consider lucky.
- Notwithstanding past Intel microcode errors, checking computer calculations like this would not be sensible. To find a computer use for your procedure:
- Consider the statement "318682 is 101558 + 217124 and squared is 101558217124" (see: Kaprekar numbers#Casting Out Nines (fast)).
- has the same checksum as (
- 101558217124
- has the same checksum as (
- ) because for a Kaprekar they are made up of the same digits (sometimes with extra zeroes)
- note that this implies that for Kaprekar numbers the checksum of

**Success Criteria:**
- Task completed according to Rosetta Code specification
