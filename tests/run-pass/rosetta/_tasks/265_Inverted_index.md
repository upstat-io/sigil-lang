# Inverted index

**Problem:** An Inverted Index is a data structure used to create full text search. Given a set of text files, implement a program to create an inverted index. Also create a user interface to do a search using that inverted index which returns a list of files that contain the query term / terms. The search index can be in memory.

**Requirements:**
- Given a set of text files, implement a program to create an inverted index.
- Also create a user interface to do a search using that inverted index which returns a list of files that contain the query term / terms.

**Success Criteria:**
- Program produces correct output for test cases
- Implementation matches Rosetta Code specification
