# Arithmetic/Integer

**Problem:** Accept two integers from a user and display results of basic arithmetic operations.

**Requirements:**
- Calculate and display:
  - Sum: a + b
  - Difference: a - b
  - Product: a × b
  - Integer quotient: a / b (note rounding direction)
  - Remainder: a mod b (note sign convention)
  - Exponentiation: a ^ b (if available)
- Document division rounding behavior (toward zero or toward negative infinity)
- Document remainder sign behavior (matches dividend or divisor)

**Success Criteria:**
- All operations produce correct results for given integer inputs
- Division and modulo behavior is clearly documented
