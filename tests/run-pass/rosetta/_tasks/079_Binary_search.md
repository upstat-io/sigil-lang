# Binary search

**Problem:** Find a value in a sorted integer array using binary search.

**Requirements:**
- Implement binary search (recursive and/or iterative)
- Given range start, end, and target value, find the value's index
- Print whether found and its index if found
- Use safe midpoint calculation: mid = low + (high - low) / 2
- Support traditional search, leftmost insertion point, and rightmost insertion point variants

**Success Criteria:**
- Returns index when value is found
- Returns -1 or insertion point when value not found
- O(log n) time complexity
