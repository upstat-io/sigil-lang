# String length

**Problem:** Find the character and byte length of a string. This means encodings like UTF-8 need to be handled properly, as there is not necessarily a one-to-one relationship between bytes and characters. By character, we mean an individual Unicode code point, not a user-visible grapheme containing combining characters. For example, the character length of "møøse" is 5 but the byte length is 7 in UTF-8 and 10 in UTF-16.

**Requirements:**
- This means encodings like UTF-8 need to be handled properly, as there is not necessarily a one-to-one relationship between bytes and characters.

**Success Criteria:**
- Program produces correct output for test cases
- Implementation matches Rosetta Code specification
