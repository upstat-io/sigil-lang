# Miller-Rabin primality test

**Problem:** The Miller–Rabin primality test or Rabin–Miller primality test is a primality test: an algorithm which determines whether a given number is prime or not. The algorithm, as modified by Michael O. Rabin to avoid the generalized Riemann hypothesis, is a probabilistic algorithm.

**Requirements:**
- The nature of the test involves big numbers, so the use of "big numbers" libraries (or similar features of the language of your choice) are suggested, but not mandatory.
- Deterministic variants of the test exist and can be implemented as extra (not mandatory to complete the task)

**Success Criteria:**
- Program produces correct output for test cases
- Implementation matches Rosetta Code specification
