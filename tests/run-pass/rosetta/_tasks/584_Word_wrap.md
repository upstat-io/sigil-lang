# Word wrap

**Problem:** Even today, with proportional fonts and complex layouts, there are still cases where you need to wrap text at a specified column. Basic task: The basic task is to wrap a paragraph of text in a simple way in your language. If there is a way to do this that is built-in, trivial, or provided in a standard library, show that. Otherwise implement the minimum length greedy algorithm from Wikipedia. Show your routine working on a sample of text at two different wrap columns.

**Requirements:**
- If there is a way to do this that is built-in, trivial, or provided in a standard library, show that.
- Otherwise implement the minimum length greedy algorithm from Wikipedia.
- Show your routine working on a sample of text at two different wrap columns.

**Success Criteria:**
- Program produces correct output for test cases
- Implementation matches Rosetta Code specification
