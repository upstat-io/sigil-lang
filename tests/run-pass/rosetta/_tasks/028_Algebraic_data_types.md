# Algebraic data types

**Problem:** Demonstrate algebraic data types by implementing red-black tree insertion.

**Red-Black Tree Properties:**
- Each node is red or black
- No red node has a red child
- All paths root→empty have same black count

**Requirements:**
- Show language support for algebraic data types
- Use pattern matching on tree structures
- Implement insertion with automatic rebalancing
- Handle four rebalancing cases

**Success Criteria:**
- Creates valid red-black tree from insertions
- Pattern matching identifies rebalancing needs
- Maintains tree balance properties
