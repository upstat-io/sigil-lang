# MAC vendor lookup

**Problem:** Every connected device around the world comes with a unique Media Access Control address, or a MAC address. A common task a network administrator may come across is being able to identify a network device's manufacturer when given only a MAC address. Interface with one (or numerous) APIs that exist on the internet and retrieve the device manufacturer based on a supplied MAC address. A MAC address that does not return a valid result should return the String "N/A".

**Requirements:**
- A MAC address that does not return a valid result should return the String "N/A".

**Success Criteria:**
- Program produces correct output for test cases
- Implementation matches Rosetta Code specification
