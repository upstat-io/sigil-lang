# Extend your language

**Problem:** Some programming languages allow you to extend the language. While this can be done to a certain degree in most languages (e.g. by using macros), other languages go much further. Most notably in the Forth and Lisp families, programming per se is done by extending the language without any formal distinction between built-in and user-defined elements. If your language supports it, show how to introduce a new flow control mechanism.

**Requirements:**
- If your language supports it, show how to introduce a new flow control mechanism.

**Success Criteria:**
- Program produces correct output for test cases
- Implementation matches Rosetta Code specification
