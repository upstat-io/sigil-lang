# Factorial

**Problem:** Definitions: n, n-1, n-2, ... 1 Write a function to return the factorial of a number. Solutions can be iterative or recursive. Support for trapping negative n errors is optional.

**Requirements:**
- The factorial of 0 (zero) is defined as being 1 (unity).
- The Factorial Function of a positive integer, n, is defined as the product of the sequence:
- Primorial numbers

**Success Criteria:**
- Program produces correct output for test cases
- Implementation matches Rosetta Code specification
