# Averages/Mode

**Problem:** Find the mode (most frequently occurring value) of a collection.

**Requirements:**
- Count frequency of each unique element
- Identify the maximum frequency
- Return all elements matching that maximum frequency (handle ties)
- Empty collections may be ignored

**Success Criteria:**
- mode([1, 3, 6, 6, 6, 6, 7, 7, 12, 12, 17]) = [6]
- mode([1, 1, 2, 4, 4]) = [1, 4] (tie)
- mode([1, 3, 5, 7, 3, 1, 3, 7, 7, 3, 3]) = [3]
