# Make directory path

**Problem:** Create a directory and any missing parents. This task is named after the posix mkdir -p command, and several libraries which implement the same behavior. Please implement a function of a single path string (for example ./path/to/dir) which has the above side-effect. If the directory already exists, return successfully. Ideally implementations will work equally well cross-platform (on windows, linux, and OS X).

**Requirements:**
- This task is named after the posix mkdir -p command, and several libraries which implement the same behavior.
- Please implement a function of a single path string (for example ./path/to/dir) which has the above side-effect.
- Ideally implementations will work equally well cross-platform (on windows, linux, and OS X).

**Success Criteria:**
- Program produces correct output for test cases
- Implementation matches Rosetta Code specification
