# Fibonacci sequence

**Problem:** The Fibonacci sequence is a sequence Fn of natural numbers defined recursively: Fn = Fn-1 + Fn-2 , if n > 1 Write a function to generate the nth Fibonacci number. Solutions can be iterative, recursive (though recursive solutions are generally considered too slow and are mostly used as an exercise in recursion), or use Binet's algebraic formula. The sequence is sometimes extended for negative numbers by using an alternating inverse of the positive values.

**Requirements:**
- Fibonacci n-step number sequences
- Leonardo numbers
- MathWorld, Fibonacci Number
- Some identities for r-Fibonacci numbers

**Success Criteria:**
- Program produces correct output for test cases
- Implementation matches Rosetta Code specification
