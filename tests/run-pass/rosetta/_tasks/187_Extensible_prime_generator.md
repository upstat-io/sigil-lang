# Extensible prime generator

**Problem:** Write a generator of prime numbers, in order, that will automatically adjust to accommodate the generation of any reasonably high prime. The routine should demonstrably rely on either: The routine should be used to: Show output on this page. Note: You may reference code already on this site if it is written to be imported/included, then only the code necessary for import and the performance of this task need be shown.

**Requirements:**
- Being based on an open-ended counter set to count without upper limit other than system or programming language limits. In this case, explain where this counter is in the code.
- Being based on a limit that is extended automatically. In this case, choose a small limit that ensures the limit will be passed when generating some of the values to be asked for below.
- Show the first twenty primes.
- Show the primes between 100 and 150.
- Show the number of primes between 7,700 and 8,000.
- Show the 10,000th prime.
- Prime Numbers. Website with large count of primes.

**Success Criteria:**
- If other methods of creating an extensible prime generator are used, the algorithm's means of extensibility/lack of limits should be stated.
