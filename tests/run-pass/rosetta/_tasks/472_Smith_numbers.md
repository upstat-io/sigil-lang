# Smith numbers

**Problem:** Smith numbers are numbers such that the sum of the decimal digits of the integers that make up that number is the same as the sum of the decimal digits of its prime factors excluding the number itself. By definition, all primes are excluded as they (naturally) satisfy this condition! Smith numbers are also known as joke numbers.
