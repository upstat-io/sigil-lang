# Four bit adder

**Problem:** "Simulate" a four-bit adder. This design can be realized using four 1-bit full adders. Each of these 1-bit full adders can be built with two half adders and an or gate. ; Finally a half adder can be made using an xor gate and an and gate. The xor gate can be made using two nots, two ands and one or. Not, or and and, the only allowed "gates" for the task, can be "imitated" by using the bitwise operators of your language.

**Requirements:**
- Implement the task according to the specification

**Success Criteria:**
- Program produces correct output for test cases
- Implementation matches Rosetta Code specification
