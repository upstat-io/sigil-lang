# Probabilistic choice

**Problem:** Given a mapping between items and their required probability of occurrence, generate a million items randomly subject to the given probabilities and compare the target probability of occurrence versus the generated values. The total of all the probabilities should equal one. (Because floating point arithmetic is involved, this is subject to rounding errors). Use the following mapping to test your programs: aleph 1/5.0 gimel 1/7.0 daleth 1/8.0 zayin 1/11.

**Requirements:**
- The total of all the probabilities should equal one.

**Success Criteria:**
- Program produces correct output for test cases
- Implementation matches Rosetta Code specification
