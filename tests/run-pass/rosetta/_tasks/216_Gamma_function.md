# Gamma function

**Problem:** Implement one algorithm (or more) to compute the Gamma (\Gamma) function (in the real field only). If your language has the function as built-in or you know a library which has it, compare your implementation's results with the results of the built-in/library function. The Gamma function can be defined as: \Gamma(x) = _0^ t^{x-1}e^{-t} dt This suggests a straightforward (but inefficient) way of computing the \Gamma through numerical integration. Better suggested methods:

**Requirements:**
- Lanczos approximation
- Stirling's approximation

**Success Criteria:**
- Program produces correct output for test cases
- Implementation matches Rosetta Code specification
