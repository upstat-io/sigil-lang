# Random number generator (included)

**Problem:** The task is to: State the type of random number generator algorithm used in a language's built-in random number generator. If the language or its immediate libraries don't provide a random number generator, skip this task. If possible, give a link to a wider explanation of the algorithm used. Note: the task is not to create an RNG, but to report on the languages in-built RNG that would be the most likely RNG used.

**Requirements:**
- Note: the task is not to create an RNG, but to report on the languages in-built RNG that would be the most likely RNG used.

**Success Criteria:**
- Program produces correct output for test cases
- Implementation matches Rosetta Code specification
