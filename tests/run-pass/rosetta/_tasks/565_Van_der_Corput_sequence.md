# Van der Corput sequence

**Problem:** When counting integers in binary, if you put a (binary) point to the right of the count then the column immediately to the left denotes a digit with a multiplier of 2^0; the digit in the next column to the left has a multiplier of 2^1; and so on. So in the following table: the binary number "10" is 1 2^1 + 0 2^0. You can also have binary digits to the right of the “point”, just as in the decimal number system.

**Requirements:**
- Create a function/method/routine that given n, generates the nth term of the van der Corput sequence in base 2.
- Use the function to compute and display the first ten members of the sequence. (The first member of the sequence is for n=0).
- As a stretch goal/extra credit, compute and show members of the sequence for bases other than 2.
- The Basic Low Discrepancy Sequences
- Non-decimal radices/Convert
- Van der Corput sequence

**Success Criteria:**
- Program produces correct output for test cases
- Implementation matches Rosetta Code specification
