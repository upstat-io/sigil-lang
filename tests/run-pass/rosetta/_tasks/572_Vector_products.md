# Vector products

**Problem:** A vector is defined as having three dimensions as being represented by an ordered collection of three numbers: (X, Y, Z). If you imagine a graph with the x and y axis being at right angles to each other and having a third, z axis coming out of the page, then a triplet of numbers, (X, Y, Z) would represent a point in the region, and a vector from the origin to the point.

**Requirements:**
- Create a named function/subroutine/method to compute the dot product of two vectors.
- Create a function to compute the cross product of two vectors.
- Optionally create a function to compute the scalar triple product of three vectors.
- Optionally create a function to compute the vector triple product of three vectors.
- Compute and display: a • b
- Compute and display: a x b
- Compute and display: a • (b x c), the scalar triple product.
- Compute and display: a x (b x c), the vector triple product.
- A starting page on Wolfram MathWorld is .
- Dot product

**Success Criteria:**
- Program produces correct output for test cases
- Implementation matches Rosetta Code specification
