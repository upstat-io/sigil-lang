# S-expressions

**Problem:** S-Expressions are one convenient way to parse and store data. Write a simple reader and writer for S-Expressions that handles quoted and unquoted strings, integers and floats. The reader should read a single but nested S-Expression from a string and store it in a suitable datastructure (list, array, etc). Newlines and other whitespace may be ignored unless contained within a quoted string. “()” inside quoted strings are not interpreted, but treated as part of the string.

**Requirements:**
- Write a simple reader and writer for S-Expressions that handles quoted and unquoted strings, integers and floats.
- The reader should read a single but nested S-Expression from a string and store it in a suitable datastructure (list, array, etc).

**Success Criteria:**
- Program produces correct output for test cases
- Implementation matches Rosetta Code specification
