# Simple database

**Problem:** Write a simple tool to track a small set of data. The tool should have a command-line interface to enter at least two different values. The entered data should be stored in a structured format and saved to disk. It does not matter what kind of data is being tracked. It could be a collection (CDs, coins, baseball cards, books), a diary, an electronic organizer (birthdays/anniversaries/phone numbers/addresses), etc.

**Requirements:**
- A category or tag (genre, topic, relationship such as “friend” or “family”)
- A date (either the date when the entry was made or some other date that is meaningful, like the birthday); the date may be generated or entered manually
- Other optional fields
- Add a new entry
- Print the latest entry
- Print the latest entry for each category
- Print all entries sorted by a date
- S-Expressions
- others
- Take notes on the command line

**Success Criteria:**
- Program produces correct output for test cases
- Implementation matches Rosetta Code specification
