# Animation

**Problem:** Create a windowed application demonstrating text animation with user interactivity.

**Requirements:**
- Create a window displaying the text "Hello World! " (with trailing space)
- Animate the text by rotating it right - repeatedly moving the last character to the front
- Handle user input - clicking on the text reverses the rotation direction
- Window must remain responsive during animation

**Success Criteria:**
- Text continuously rotates character-by-character at regular intervals
- Mouse click on text toggles between rightward and leftward rotation
- Application continues until user closes the window
