# Chinese remainder theorem

**Problem:** Suppose n 1 }} , n 2 }} , … } , n k }} are positive integers that are pairwise co-prime.

**Requirements:**
- Then, for any given sequence of integers
- , there exists an integer
- solving the following system of simultaneous congruences:
- x a{ } a{ } a{ }}}}
- Furthermore, all solutions
- of this system are congruent modulo the product,
- Write a program to solve a system of linear congruences by applying the Chinese Remainder Theorem.
- If the system of equations cannot be solved, your program must somehow indicate this.

**Success Criteria:**
- Task completed according to Rosetta Code specification
