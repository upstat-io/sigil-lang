# UTF-8 encode and decode

**Problem:** As described in UTF-8 and in Wikipedia, UTF-8 is a popular encoding of (multi-byte) Unicode code-points into eight-bit octets. The goal of this task is to write a encoder that takes a unicode code-point (an integer representing a unicode character) and returns a sequence of 1–4 bytes representing that character in the UTF-8 encoding. Then you have to write the corresponding decoder that takes a sequence of 1–4 UTF-8 encoded bytes and return the corresponding unicode character.

**Requirements:**
- The goal of this task is to write a encoder that takes a unicode code-point (an integer representing a unicode character) and returns a sequence of 1–4 bytes representing that character in the UTF-8 encoding.
- Then you have to write the corresponding decoder that takes a sequence of 1–4 UTF-8 encoded bytes and return the corresponding unicode character.

**Success Criteria:**
- Program produces correct output for test cases
- Implementation matches Rosetta Code specification
