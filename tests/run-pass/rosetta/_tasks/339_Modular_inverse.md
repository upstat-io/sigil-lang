# Modular inverse

**Problem:** From Wikipedia: In modular arithmetic, the modular multiplicative inverse of an integer a modulo m is an integer x such that Or in other words, such that: k \Z, a\, x = 1 + k\,m It can be shown that such an inverse exists if and only if a and m are coprime, but we will ignore this for this task. Either by implementing the algorithm, by using a dedicated library or by using a built-in function in your language, compute the modular inverse of 42 modulo 2017.

**Requirements:**
- Either by implementing the algorithm, by using a dedicated library or by using a built-in function in your language, compute the modular inverse of 42 modulo 2017.

**Success Criteria:**
- Program produces correct output for test cases
- Implementation matches Rosetta Code specification
