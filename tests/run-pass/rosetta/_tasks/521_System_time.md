# System time

**Problem:** Output the system time (any units will do as long as they are noted) either by a system command or one built into the language. The system time can be used for debugging, network information, random number seeds, or something as simple as program performance.

**Requirements:**
- Date format

**Success Criteria:**
- Program produces correct output for test cases
- Implementation matches Rosetta Code specification
