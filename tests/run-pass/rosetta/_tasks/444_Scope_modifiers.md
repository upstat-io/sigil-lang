# Scope modifiers

**Problem:** Most programming languages offer support for subroutines. When execution changes between subroutines, different sets of variables and functions ("scopes") are available to the program. Frequently these sets are defined by the placement of the variable and function declarations ("static scoping" or "lexical scoping"). These sets may also be defined by special modifiers to the variable and function declarations.

**Requirements:**
- Implement the task according to the specification

**Success Criteria:**
- Program produces correct output for test cases
- Implementation matches Rosetta Code specification
