# History variables

**Problem:** Storing the history of objects in a program is a common task. Maintaining the history of an object in a program has traditionally required programmers either to write specific code for handling the historical data, or to use a library which supports history logging. History variables are variables in a programming language which store not only their current value, but also the values they have contained in the past. Some existing languages do provide support for history variables.

**Requirements:**
- define a history variable
- assign three values
- non-destructively display the history
- recall the three values.

**Success Criteria:**
- Program produces correct output for test cases
- Implementation matches Rosetta Code specification
