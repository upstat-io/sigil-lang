# AVL tree

**Problem:** Implement a self-balancing binary search tree where subtree heights differ by at most one.

**Requirements:**
- Maintain balance property: child subtree heights differ by maximum of one
- Implement tree rotations (left and right) for rebalancing
- Support insertion with rebalancing
- Support deletion with rebalancing
- Support search by key
- No duplicate keys allowed
- All operations must be O(log n)

**Success Criteria:**
- Insertions maintain AVL balance property
- Deletions maintain AVL balance property
- Lookups complete in O(log n) time
