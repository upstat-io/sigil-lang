# File input/output

**Problem:** Create a file called "output.txt", and place in it the contents of the file "input.txt", via an intermediate variable. In other words, your program will demonstrate: Oneliners that skip the intermediate variable are of secondary interest — operating systems have copy commands for that.

**Requirements:**
- how to read from a file into a variable
- how to write a variable's contents into a file

**Success Criteria:**
- Program produces correct output for test cases
- Implementation matches Rosetta Code specification
