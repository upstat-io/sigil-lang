# Farey sequence

**Problem:** The Farey sequence Fn of order n is the sequence of completely reduced fractions between 0 and 1 which, when in lowest terms, have denominators less than or equal to n, arranged in order of increasing size. The Farey sequence is sometimes incorrectly called a Farey series.

**Requirements:**
- starts with the value 0 (zero), denoted by the fraction {1}
- ends with the value 1 (unity), denoted by the fraction {1}.
- Compute and show the Farey sequence for orders 1 through 11 (inclusive).
- Compute and display the number of fractions in the Farey sequence for order 100 through 1,000 (inclusive) by hundreds.
- Show the fractions as n/d (using the solidus [or slash] to separate the numerator from the denominator).
- MathWorld entry Farey sequence

**Success Criteria:**
- Program produces correct output for test cases
- Implementation matches Rosetta Code specification
