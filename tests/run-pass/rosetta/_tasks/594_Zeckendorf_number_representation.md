# Zeckendorf number representation

**Problem:** Just as numbers can be represented in a positional notation as sums of multiples of the powers of ten (decimal) or two (binary); all the positive integers can be represented as the sum of one or zero times the distinct members of the Fibonacci series. Recall that the first six distinct Fibonacci numbers are: 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13.
