# Happy numbers

**Problem:** From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia: A happy number is defined by the following process: Starting with any positive integer, replace the number by the sum of the squares of its digits, and repeat the process until the number equals 1 (where it will stay), or it loops endlessly in a cycle which does not include 1. Those numbers for which this process end in 1 are happy numbers, while those numbers that do not end in 1 are unhappy numbers. Find and print the first 8 happy numbers.

**Requirements:**
- Iterated digits squaring
- The OEIS entry: The happy numbers: A007770
- The OEIS entry: The unhappy numbers; A031177

**Success Criteria:**
- Program produces correct output for test cases
- Implementation matches Rosetta Code specification
