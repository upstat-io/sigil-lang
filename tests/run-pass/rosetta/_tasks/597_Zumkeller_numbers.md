# Zumkeller numbers

**Problem:** Zumkeller numbers are the set of numbers whose divisors can be partitioned into two disjoint sets that sum to the same value. Each sum must contain divisor values that are not in the other sum, and all of the divisors must be in one or the other. There are no restrictions on how the divisors are partitioned, only that the two partition sums are equal. 6 is a Zumkeller number; The divisors {1 2 3 6} can be partitioned into two groups {1 2 3} and {6} that both sum to 6.

**Requirements:**
- Write a routine (function, procedure, whatever) to find Zumkeller numbers.
- Use the routine to find and display here, on this page, the first 220 Zumkeller numbers.
- Use the routine to find and display here, on this page, the first 40 odd Zumkeller numbers.
- Optional, stretch goal: Use the routine to find and display here, on this page, the first 40 odd Zumkeller numbers that don't end with 5.
- Abundant odd numbers
- Abundant, deficient and perfect number classifications
- Proper divisors , Factors of an integer

**Success Criteria:**
- Program produces correct output for test cases
- Implementation matches Rosetta Code specification
