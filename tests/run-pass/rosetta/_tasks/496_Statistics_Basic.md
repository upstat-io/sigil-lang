# Statistics/Basic

**Problem:** Statistics is all about large groups of numbers. When talking about a set of sampled data, most frequently used is their mean value and standard deviation (stddev). If you have set of data x_i where i = 1, 2, , n\,\!, the mean is {1 n}_i x_i, while the stddev is _i (x_i - x )^2}. When examining a large quantity of data, one often uses a histogram, which shows the counts of data samples falling into a prechosen set of intervals (or bins).

**Requirements:**
- Statistics/Normal distribution

**Success Criteria:**
- Program produces correct output for test cases
- Implementation matches Rosetta Code specification
