# Closures/Value capture

**Problem:** Task Create a list of ten functions, in the simplest manner possible (anonymous functions are encouraged), such that the function at index i (you may choose to start i from either 0 or 1), when run, should return the square of the index, that is, i 2. Display the result of running any but the last function, to demonstrate that the function indeed remembers its value.

**Requirements:**
- Demonstrate how to create a series of independent closures based on the same template but maintain separate copies of the variable closed over.
- In imperative languages, one would generally use a loop with a mutable counter variable.
- See also: Multiple distinct objects

**Success Criteria:**
- Task completed according to Rosetta Code specification
