# Generate lower case ASCII alphabet

**Problem:** Generate an array, list, lazy sequence, or even an indexable string of all the lower case ASCII characters, from a to z. If the standard library contains such a sequence, show how to access it, but don't fail to show how to generate a similar sequence. For this basic task use a reliable style of coding, a style fit for a very large program, and use strong typing if available. It's bug prone to enumerate all the lowercase characters manually in the code.

**Requirements:**
- If the standard library contains such a sequence, show how to access it, but don't fail to show how to generate a similar sequence.

**Success Criteria:**
- Program produces correct output for test cases
- Implementation matches Rosetta Code specification
