# Permutations by swapping

**Problem:** Generate permutations of n items in which successive permutations differ from each other by the swapping of any two items. Also generate the sign of the permutation which is +1 when the permutation is generated from an even number of swaps from the initial state, and -1 for odd. Show the permutations and signs of three items, in order of generation here. Such data are of use in generating the determinant of a square matrix and any functions created should bear this in mind.

**Requirements:**
- Steinhaus–Johnson–Trotter algorithm
- Johnson-Trotter Algorithm Listing All Permutations
- Heap's algorithm
- Tintinnalogia
- Matrix arithmetic
- Gray code

**Success Criteria:**
- Program produces correct output for test cases
- Implementation matches Rosetta Code specification
