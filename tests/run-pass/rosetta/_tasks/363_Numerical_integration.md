# Numerical integration

**Problem:** Write functions to calculate the definite integral of a function using all five of the following methods: Your functions should take in the upper and lower bounds ( and ), and the number of approximations to make in that range (). Assume that your example already has a function that gives values for .

**Requirements:**
- rectangular
- midpoint
- trapezium
- Simpson's
- composite
- Active object for integrating a function of real time.
- Special:PrefixIndex/Numerical integration for other integration methods.

**Success Criteria:**
- , where x is [0,1], with 100 approximations. The exact result is 0.25 (or 1/4)
- , where x is [1,100], with 1,000 approximations. The exact result is 4.605170+ (natural log of 100)
- , where x is [0,5000], with 5,000,000 approximations. The exact result is 12,500,000
- , where x is [0,6000], with 6,000,000 approximations. The exact result is 18,000,000
