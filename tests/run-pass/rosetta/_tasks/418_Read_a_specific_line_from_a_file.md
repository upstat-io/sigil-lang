# Read a specific line from a file

**Problem:** Some languages have special semantics for obtaining a known line number from a file. Demonstrate how to obtain the contents of a specific line within a file. For the purpose of this task demonstrate how the contents of the seventh line of a file can be obtained, and store it in a variable or in memory (for potential future use within the program if the code were to become embedded).

**Requirements:**
- Demonstrate how to obtain the contents of a specific line within a file.
- For the purpose of this task demonstrate how the contents of the seventh line of a file can be obtained, and store it in a variable or in memory (for potential future use within the program if the code were to become embedded).

**Success Criteria:**
- Program produces correct output for test cases
- Implementation matches Rosetta Code specification
