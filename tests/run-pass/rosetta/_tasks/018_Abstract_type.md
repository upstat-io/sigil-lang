# Abstract type

**Problem:** Demonstrate how to declare an abstract type in the language.

**Requirements:**
- Show syntax for declaring an abstract type
- Abstract type = type without instances or without full definition
- If language distinguishes interfaces vs partially-implemented types, show both:
  - Interface: no implementation, only signatures
  - Abstract class: mix of abstract and concrete methods
- Show how to create concrete implementations

**Success Criteria:**
- Demonstrates abstract type declaration
- Shows prevention of direct instantiation
- Includes concrete subclass fulfilling requirements
