# Haversine formula

**Problem:** The haversine formula is an equation important in navigation, giving great-circle distances between two points on a sphere from their longitudes and latitudes. It is a special case of a more general formula in spherical trigonometry, the law of haversines, relating the sides and angles of spherical "triangles". Implement a great-circle distance function, or use a library function, to show the great-circle distance between: N 36°7.2', W 86°40.2' (36.12, -86.67) -and- N 33°56.4', W 118°24.0' (33.
