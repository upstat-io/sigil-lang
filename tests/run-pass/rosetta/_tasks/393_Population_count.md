# Population count

**Problem:** The population count is the number of 1s (ones) in the binary representation of a non-negative integer. Population count is also known as: For example, 5 (which is 101 in binary) has a population count of 2. Evil numbers are non-negative integers that have an even population count. Odious numbers are positive integers that have an odd population count.

**Requirements:**
- pop count
- popcount
- sideways sum
- bit summation
- Hamming weight
- display the pop count of the 1st thirty powers of 3 (30, 31, 32, 33, 34, ∙∙∙ 329).
- display the 1st thirty evil numbers.
- display the 1st thirty odious numbers.
- The On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences: A000120 population count.
- The On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences: A000069 odious numbers.

**Success Criteria:**
- write a function (or routine) to return the population count of a non-negative integer.
- all computation of the lists below should start with 0 (zero indexed).
- display each list of integers on one line (which may or may not include a title), each set of integers being shown should be properly identified.
