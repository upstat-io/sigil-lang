# Arithmetic/Rational

**Problem:** Implement rational number arithmetic with automatic reduction to lowest terms.

**Requirements:**
- Define a rational type with numerator and denominator
- Implement unary operators: abs, negation
- Implement binary operators: +, -, ×, /, integer division, modulo
- Implement comparison: <, ≤, >, ≥, =, ≠
- Automatically reduce fractions using GCD
- Support integer to rational conversion

**Success Criteria:**
- Find all perfect numbers less than 2^19 by summing reciprocals of factors
- Expected output: 6, 28, 496, 8128 are perfect
- Fractions maintain lowest terms throughout calculations
