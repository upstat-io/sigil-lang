# Longest increasing subsequence

**Problem:** Calculate and show here a longest increasing subsequence of the list: \{3, 2, 6, 4, 5, 1\} And of the list: \{0, 8, 4, 12, 2, 10, 6, 14, 1, 9, 5, 13, 3, 11, 7, 15\} Note that a list may have more than one subsequence that is of the maximum length.

**Requirements:**
- Dynamic Programming #1: Longest Increasing Subsequence on YouTube
- An efficient solution can be based on Patience sorting.

**Success Criteria:**
- Program produces correct output for test cases
