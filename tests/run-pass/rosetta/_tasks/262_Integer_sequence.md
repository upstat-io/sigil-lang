# Integer sequence

**Problem:** Create a program that, when run, would display all integers from 1 to (or any relevant implementation limit), in sequence (i.e. 1, 2, 3, 4, etc) if given enough time. An example may not be able to reach arbitrarily-large numbers based on implementations limits. For example, if integers are represented as a 32-bit unsigned value with 0 as the smallest representable value, the largest representable value would be 4,294,967,295.

**Requirements:**
- An example may not be able to reach arbitrarily-large numbers based on implementations limits.

**Success Criteria:**
- Program produces correct output for test cases
- Implementation matches Rosetta Code specification
