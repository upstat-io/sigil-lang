# Truncate a file

**Problem:** Truncate a file to a specific length. This should be implemented as a routine that takes two parameters: the filename and the required file length (in bytes). Truncation can be achieved using system or library calls intended for such a task, if such methods exist, or by creating a temporary file of a reduced size and renaming it, after first deleting the original file, if no other method is available.

**Requirements:**
- This should be implemented as a routine that takes two parameters: the filename and the required file length (in bytes).

**Success Criteria:**
- Program produces correct output for test cases
- Implementation matches Rosetta Code specification
