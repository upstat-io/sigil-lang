# General FizzBuzz

**Problem:** Write a generalized version of FizzBuzz that works for any list of factors, along with their words. This is basically a "fizzbuzz" implementation where the user supplies the parameters. The user will enter the max number, then they will enter the factors to be calculated along with the corresponding word to be printed. For simplicity's sake, assume the user will input an integer as the max number and 3 factors, each with a word associated with them.

**Requirements:**
- This is basically a "fizzbuzz" implementation where the user supplies the parameters.

**Success Criteria:**
- Program produces correct output for test cases
- Implementation matches Rosetta Code specification
