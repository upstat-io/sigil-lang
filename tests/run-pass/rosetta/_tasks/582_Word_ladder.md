# Word ladder

**Problem:** Yet another shortest path problem. Given two words of equal length the task is to transpose the first into the second. Only one letter may be changed at a time and the change must result in a word in unixdict, the minimum number of intermediate words should be used.

**Requirements:**
- Only one letter may be changed at a time and the change must result in a word in unixdict, the minimum number of intermediate words should be used.

**Success Criteria:**
- Program produces correct output for test cases
- Implementation matches Rosetta Code specification
