# Non-decimal radices/Input

**Problem:** It is common to have a string containing a number written in some format, with the most common ones being decimal, hexadecimal, octal and binary. Such strings are found in many places (user interfaces, configuration files, XML data, network protocols, etc.) This task requires parsing of such a string (which may be assumed to contain nothing else) using the language's built-in facilities if possible.

**Requirements:**
- Such strings are found in many places (user interfaces, configuration files, XML data, network protocols, etc.) This task requires parsing of such a string (which may be assumed to contain nothing else) using the language's built-in facilities if possible.

**Success Criteria:**
- Program produces correct output for test cases
- Implementation matches Rosetta Code specification
