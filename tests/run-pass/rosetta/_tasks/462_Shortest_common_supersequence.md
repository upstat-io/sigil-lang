# Shortest common supersequence

**Problem:** The shortest common supersequence is a problem closely related to the longest common subsequence, which you can use as an external function for this task. Given two strings u and v, find the shortest possible sequence s, which is the shortest common super-sequence of u and v where both u and v are a subsequence of s. Defined as such, s is not necessarily unique. Demonstrate this by printing s where u = “abcbdab” and v = “bdcaba”.

**Requirements:**
- Demonstrate this by printing s where u = “abcbdab” and v = “bdcaba”.

**Success Criteria:**
- Program produces correct output for test cases
- Implementation matches Rosetta Code specification
