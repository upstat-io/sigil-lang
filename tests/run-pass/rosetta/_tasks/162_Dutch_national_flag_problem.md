# Dutch national flag problem

**Problem:** The Dutch national flag is composed of three coloured bands in the order: red (top) then white, and lastly blue (at the bottom). The problem posed by Edsger Dijkstra is: Given a number of red, blue and white balls in random order, arrange them in the order of the colours in the Dutch national flag.

**Requirements:**
- Generate a randomized order of balls ensuring that they are not in the order of the Dutch national flag.
- Sort the balls in a way idiomatic to your language.
- Check the sorted balls are in the order of the Dutch national flag.
- Dutch national flag problem
- Probabilistic analysis of algorithms for the Dutch national flag problem by Wei-Mei Chen. (pdf)

**Success Criteria:**
- Task completed according to Rosetta Code specification
