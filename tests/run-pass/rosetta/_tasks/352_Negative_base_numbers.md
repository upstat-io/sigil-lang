# Negative base numbers

**Problem:** Negative base numbers are an alternate way to encode numbers without the need for a minus sign. Various negative bases may be used including negadecimal (base -10), negabinary (-2) and negaternary (-3).Negabinary on Wolfram MathworldNegative base on Wikipedia extra credit:

**Requirements:**
- In each of the above cases, convert the encoded number back to decimal.
- supply an integer, that when encoded to base -62 (or something "higher"), expresses the name of the language being used (with correct capitalization). If the computer language has non-alphanumeric characters, try to encode them into the negatory numerals, or use other characters instead.

**Success Criteria:**
- Encode the decimal number 10 as negabinary (expect 11110)
- Encode the decimal number 146 as negaternary (expect 21102)
- Encode the decimal number 15 as negadecimal (expect 195)
