# Prime decomposition

**Problem:** The prime decomposition of a number is defined as a list of prime numbers which when all multiplied together, are equal to that number. 12 = 2 2 3, so its prime decomposition is {2, 2, 3} Write a function which returns an array or collection which contains the prime decomposition of a given number n greater than 1. If your language does not have an isPrime-like function available, you may assume that you have a function which determines whether a number is prime (note its name before your code).

**Requirements:**
- count in factors
- factors of an integer
- Sieve of Eratosthenes
- primality by trial division
- factors of a Mersenne number
- trial factoring of a Mersenne number
- partition an integer X into N primes
- sequence of primes by Trial Division

**Success Criteria:**
- Program produces correct output for test cases
- Implementation matches Rosetta Code specification
