# Equilibrium index

**Problem:** An equilibrium index of a sequence is an index into the sequence such that the sum of elements at lower indices is equal to the sum of elements at higher indices. For example, in a sequence A: 3 is an equilibrium index, because: A_0 + A_1 + A_2 = A_4 + A_5 + A_6 6 is also an equilibrium index, because: A_0 + A_1 + A_2 + A_3 + A_4 + A_5 = 0 (sum of zero elements is zero) 7 is not an equilibrium index, because it is not a valid index of sequence A.

**Requirements:**
- Implement the task according to the specification

**Success Criteria:**
- Program produces correct output for test cases
- Implementation matches Rosetta Code specification
