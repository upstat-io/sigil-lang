# Handle a signal

**Problem:** Most operating systems provide interrupt facilities, sometimes called signals either generated by the user or as a result of program failure or reaching a limit like file space. Unhandled signals generally terminate a program in a disorderly manner. Signal handlers are created so that the program behaves in a well-defined manner upon receipt of a signal. Provide a program that displays an integer on each line of output at the rate of about one per half second.

**Requirements:**
- Signal handlers are created so that the program behaves in a well-defined manner upon receipt of a signal.
- Provide a program that displays an integer on each line of output at the rate of about one per half second.

**Success Criteria:**
- Program produces correct output for test cases
- Implementation matches Rosetta Code specification
