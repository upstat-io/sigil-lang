# Sum of a series

**Problem:** Compute the nth term of a series, i.e. the sum of the n first terms of the corresponding sequence. Informally this value, or its limit when n tends to infinity, is also called the sum of the series, thus the title of this task. For this task, use: S_n = _{k=1}^n {k^2} and compute S_{1000} This approximates the zeta function for S=2, whose exact value (2) = {^2 6} is the solution of the Basel problem.

**Requirements:**
- Implement the task according to the specification

**Success Criteria:**
- Program produces correct output for test cases
- Implementation matches Rosetta Code specification
