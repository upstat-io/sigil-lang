# Compiler/lexical analyzer

**Problem:** Lexical Analyzer Definition from Wikipedia: Lexical analysis is the process of converting a sequence of characters (such as in a computer program or web page) into a sequence of tokens (strings with an identified "meaning"). A program that performs lexical analysis may be called a lexer, tokenizer, or scanner (though "scanner" is also used to refer to the first stage of a lexer).

**Requirements:**
- Create a lexical analyzer for the simple programming language specified below. The
- program should read input from a file and/or stdin, and write output to a file and/or
- stdout. If the language being used has a lexer module/library/class, it would be great
- if two versions of the solution are provided: One without the lexer module, and one with.
- The simple programming language to be analyzed is more or less a subset of C. It supports the following tokens:
- The - token should always be interpreted as Opubtract by the lexer. Turning some Opubtract into Opegate will be the job of the syntax analyzer, which is not part of this task.
- Identifiers and literals
- These differ from the the previous tokens, in that each occurrence of them has a value associated with it.

**Success Criteria:**
- Task completed according to Rosetta Code specification
