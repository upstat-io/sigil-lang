# Stack

**Problem:** A stack is a container of elements with last in, first out access policy. Sometimes it also called LIFO. The stack is accessed through its top. The basic stack operations are: Sometimes the last pushed stack element is made accessible for immutable access (for read) or mutable access (for write): Stacks allow a very simple hardware implementation. They are common in almost all processors. In programming, stacks are also very popular for their way (LIFO) of resource management, usually memory.

**Requirements:**
- push stores a new element onto the stack top;
- empty tests if the stack contains no elements.

**Success Criteria:**
- pop returns the last pushed stack element, while removing it from the stack;
- top (sometimes called peek to keep with the p theme) returns the topmost element without modifying the stack.
