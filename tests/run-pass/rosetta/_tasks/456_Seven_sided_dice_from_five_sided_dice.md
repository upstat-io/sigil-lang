# Seven-sided dice from five-sided dice

**Problem:** (Given an equal-probability generator of one of the integers 1 to 5 as dice5), create dice7 that generates a pseudo-random integer from 1 to 7 in equal probability using only dice5 as a source of random numbers, and check the distribution for at least one million calls using the function created in Simple Random Distribution Checker.

**Requirements:**
- Implement the task according to the specification

**Success Criteria:**
- Program produces correct output for test cases
- Implementation matches Rosetta Code specification
