# First-class functions

**Problem:** A language has first-class functions if it can do each of the following without recursively invoking a compiler or interpreter or otherwise metaprogramming: Write a program to create an ordered collection A of functions of a real number. At least one function should be built-in and at least one should be user-defined; try using the sine, cosine, and cubing functions. Fill another collection B with the inverse of each function in A. Implement function composition as in Functional Composition.

**Requirements:**
- Create new functions from preexisting functions at run-time
- Store functions in collections
- Use functions as arguments to other functions

**Success Criteria:**
- Use functions as return values of other functions
