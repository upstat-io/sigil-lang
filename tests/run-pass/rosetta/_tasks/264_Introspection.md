# Introspection

**Problem:** Extra credit:

**Requirements:**
- verify the version/revision of your currently running (compiler/interpreter/byte-compiler/runtime environment/whatever your language uses) and exit if it is too old.
- check whether the variable "bloop" exists and whether the math-function "abs()" is available and if yes compute abs(bloop).
- Report the number of integer variables in global scope, and their sum.

**Success Criteria:**
- Program produces correct output for test cases
- Implementation matches Rosetta Code specification
