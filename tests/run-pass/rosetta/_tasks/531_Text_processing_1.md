**Problem:** Often data is produced by one program, in the wrong format for later use by another program or person. In these situations another program can be written to parse and transform the original data into a format useful to the other. The term "Data Munging" is often used in programming circles for this task. A request on the comp.lang.

**Requirements:**
- Implement the task according to the specification

**Success Criteria:**
- Program produces correct output for test cases
- Implementation matches Rosetta Code specification
