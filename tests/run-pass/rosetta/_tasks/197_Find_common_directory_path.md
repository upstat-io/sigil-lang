# Find common directory path

**Problem:** Create a routine that, given a set of strings representing directory paths and a single character directory separator, will return a string representing that part of the directory tree that is common to all the directories. Test your routine using the forward slash '/' character as the directory separator and the following three strings as input paths: '/home/user1/tmp/coverage/test' '/home/user1/tmp/covert/operator' '/home/user1/tmp/coven/members' Note: The resultant path should be the valid di

**Requirements:**
- Test your routine using the forward slash '/' character as the directory separator and the following three strings as input paths: '/home/user1/tmp/coverage/test' '/home/user1/tmp/covert/operator' '/home/user1/tmp/coven/members' Note: The resultant path should be the valid di

**Success Criteria:**
- Program produces correct output for test cases
- Implementation matches Rosetta Code specification
