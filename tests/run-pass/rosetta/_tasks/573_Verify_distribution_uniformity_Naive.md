# Verify distribution uniformity/Naive

**Problem:** This task is an adjunct to Seven-sided dice from five-sided dice. Create a function to check that the random integers returned from a small-integer generator function have uniform distribution. The function should take as arguments: The function should produce: Show the distribution checker working when the produced distribution is flat enough and when it is not. (Use a generator from Seven-sided dice from five-sided dice).

**Requirements:**
- The function (or object) producing random integers.
- The number of times to call the integer generator.
- A 'delta' value of some sort that indicates how close to a flat distribution is close enough.
- Some indication of the distribution achieved.
- An 'error' if the distribution is not flat enough.
- Verify distribution uniformity/Chi-squared test

**Success Criteria:**
- Program produces correct output for test cases
- Implementation matches Rosetta Code specification
