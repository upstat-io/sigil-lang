# Combinations with repetitions

**Problem:** The set of combinations with repetitions is computed from a set, S } (of cardinality n } ), and a size of resulting selection, k } , by reporting the sets of cardinality k } where each member of those sets is chosen from S } .

**Requirements:**
- In the real world, it is about choosing sets where there is a “large” supply of each type of element and where the order of choice does not matter.
- For example:
- Q: How many ways can a person choose two doughnuts from a store selling three types of doughnut: iced, jam, and plain? (i.e.,
- Note that both the order of items within a pair, and the order of the pairs given in the answer is not significant
- the pairs represent multisets.
- Also note that doughnut can also be spelled donut.
- Write a function/program/routine/.. to generate all the combinations with repetitions of
- types of things taken

**Success Criteria:**
- Task completed according to Rosetta Code specification
