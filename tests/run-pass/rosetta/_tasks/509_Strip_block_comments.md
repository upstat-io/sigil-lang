# Strip block comments

**Problem:** A block comment begins with a beginning delimiter and ends with a ending delimiter, including the delimiters. These delimiters are often multi-character sequences. Strip block comments from program text (of a programming language much like classic C). Your demos should at least handle simple, non-nested and multi-line block comment delimiters.

**Requirements:**
- Some comments
- longer comments here that we can parse.

**Success Criteria:**
- Program produces correct output for test cases
- Implementation matches Rosetta Code specification
