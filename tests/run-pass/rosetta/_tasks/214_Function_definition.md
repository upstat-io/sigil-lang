# Function definition

**Problem:** A function is a body of code that returns a value. The value returned may depend on arguments provided to the function. Write a definition of a function called "multiply" that takes two arguments and returns their product. (Argument types should be chosen so as not to distract from showing how functions are created and values returned).

**Requirements:**
- Function prototype

**Success Criteria:**
- Program produces correct output for test cases
- Implementation matches Rosetta Code specification
