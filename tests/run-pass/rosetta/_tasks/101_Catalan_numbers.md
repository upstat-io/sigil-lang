# Catalan numbers

**Problem:** Catalan numbers are a sequence of numbers which can be defined directly: C n = 1 n + 1 ( 2 n n ) = ( 2 n ) !

**Requirements:**
- ={ }={ } {}n 0.}}
- Or recursively:
- =1 {} C= C ,C {}n 0
- Or alternatively (also recursive):
- =1 {} C={ }C,}}
- Implement at least one of these algorithms and print out the first 15 Catalan numbers with each.
- Memoization is not required, but may be worth the effort when using the second method above.
- Related tasks

**Success Criteria:**
- Task completed according to Rosetta Code specification
