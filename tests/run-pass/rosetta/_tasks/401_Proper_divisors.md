# Proper divisors

**Problem:** The proper divisors of a positive integer N are those numbers, other than N itself, that divide N without remainder. For N > 1 they will always include 1, but for N == 1 there are no proper divisors. The proper divisors of 6 are 1, 2, and 3. The proper divisors of 100 are 1, 2, 4, 5, 10, 20, 25, and 50. Show all output here. Related tasks:

**Requirements:**
- Create a routine to generate all the proper divisors of a number.
