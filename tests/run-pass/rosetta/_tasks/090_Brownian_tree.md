# Brownian tree

**Problem:** Generate a Brownian tree through particle aggregation.

**Requirements:**
- Place an initial seed point in the field
- Inject particles that move with random motion
- When a particle contacts the tree, it becomes fixed and joins the structure
- Display or output the resulting tree

**Success Criteria:**
- Produces a fractal-like tree structure
- Each run produces a unique tree due to randomness
- Demonstrates diffusion-limited aggregation
