# Sequence of primes by trial division

**Problem:** Generate a sequence of primes by means of trial division. Trial division is an algorithm where a candidate number is tested for being a prime by trying to divide it by other numbers. You may use primes, or any numbers of your choosing, as long as the result is indeed a sequence of primes. The sequence may be bounded (i.e. up to some limit), unbounded, starting from the start (i.e. 2) or above some given value.

**Requirements:**
- count in factors
- prime decomposition
- factors of an integer
- Sieve of Eratosthenes
- primality by trial division
- factors of a Mersenne number
- trial factoring of a Mersenne number
- partition an integer X into N primes

**Success Criteria:**
- Program produces correct output for test cases
- Implementation matches Rosetta Code specification
