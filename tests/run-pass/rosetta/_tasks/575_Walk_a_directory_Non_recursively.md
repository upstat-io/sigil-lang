# Walk a directory/Non-recursively

**Problem:** Walk a given directory and print the names of files matching a given pattern. (How is "pattern" defined? substring match? DOS pattern? BASH pattern? ZSH pattern? Perl regular expression?) Note: This task is for non-recursive methods. These tasks should read a single directory, not an entire directory tree. Note: Please be careful when running any code presented here.

**Requirements:**
- Walk Directory Tree (read entire directory tree).

**Success Criteria:**
- Program produces correct output for test cases
- Implementation matches Rosetta Code specification
