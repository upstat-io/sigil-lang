# Runge-Kutta method

**Problem:** Given the example Differential equation: y'(t) = t {y(t)} With initial condition: t_0 = 0 and y_0 = y(t_0) = y(0) = 1 This equation has an exact solution: y(t) = {16}(t^2 +4)^2 Demonstrate the commonly used explicit fourth-order Runge–Kutta method to solve the above differential equation.

**Requirements:**
- Solve the given differential equation over the range t = 0 10 with a step value of t=0.1 (101 total points, the first being given)
- Print the calculated values of y at whole numbered t's (0.0, 1.0, 10.0) along with error as compared to the exact solution.

**Success Criteria:**
- Program produces correct output for test cases
- Implementation matches Rosetta Code specification
