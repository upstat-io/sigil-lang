# Non-decimal radices/Output

**Problem:** Programming languages often have built-in routines to convert a non-negative integer for printing in different number bases. Such common number bases might include binary, Octal and Hexadecimal. Print a small range of integers in some different bases, as supported by standard routines of your programming language. This is distinct from Number base conversion as a user-defined conversion function is not asked for.) The reverse operation is Common number base parsing.

**Requirements:**
- Implement the task according to the specification

**Success Criteria:**
- Program produces correct output for test cases
- Implementation matches Rosetta Code specification
