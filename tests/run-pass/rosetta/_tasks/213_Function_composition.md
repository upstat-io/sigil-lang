# Function composition

**Problem:** Create a function, compose, whose two arguments f and g, are both functions with one argument. The result of compose is to be a function of one argument, (lets call the argument x), which works like applying function f to the result of applying function g to x. compose(f, g) (x) = f(g(x)) Reference: Function composition Hint: In some languages, implementing compose correctly requires creating a closure.

**Requirements:**
- compose(f, g) (x) = f(g(x)) Reference: Function composition Hint: In some languages, implementing compose correctly requires creating a closure.

**Success Criteria:**
- Program produces correct output for test cases
- Implementation matches Rosetta Code specification
