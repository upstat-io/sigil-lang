# Stable marriage problem

**Problem:** Solve the Stable marriage problem using the Gale/Shapley algorithm. Problem description Given an equal number of men and women to be paired for marriage, each man ranks all the women in order of his preference and each woman ranks all the men in order of her preference. A stable set of engagements for marriage is one where no man prefers a woman over the one he is engaged to, where that other woman also prefers that man over the one she is engaged to. I.e.

**Requirements:**
- Use the Gale Shapley algorithm to find a stable set of engagements
- Perturb this set of engagements to form an unstable set of engagements then check this new set for stability.
- The Stable Marriage Problem. (Eloquent description and background information).
- Gale-Shapley Algorithm Demonstration.
- Another Gale-Shapley Algorithm Demonstration.
- Stable Marriage Problem - Numberphile (Video).
- Stable Marriage Problem (the math bit) (Video).
- The Stable Marriage Problem and School Choice. (Excellent exposition)

**Success Criteria:**
- Program produces correct output for test cases
- Implementation matches Rosetta Code specification
