# Dijkstra's algorithm

**Problem:** Dijkstra's algorithm, conceived by Dutch computer scientist Edsger Dijkstra in 1956 and published in 1959, is a graph search algorithm that solves the single-source shortest path problem for a graph with non-negative edge path costs, producing a shortest path tree. This algorithm is often used in routing and as a subroutine in other graph algorithms.

**Requirements:**
- For a given source vertex (node) in the graph, the algorithm finds the path with lowest cost (i.e. the shortest path) between that vertex and every other vertex.
- For instance
- As a result, the shortest path first is widely used in network routing protocols, most notably:
- IS-IS (Intermediate System to Intermediate System) and
- OSPF (Open Shortest Path First).
- Important note
- The inputs to Dijkstra's algorithm are a directed and weighted graph consisting of 2 or more nodes, generally represented by:
- an adjacency matrix or list, and

**Success Criteria:**
- Task completed according to Rosetta Code specification
