# Vector

**Problem:** Implement a Vector class (or a set of functions) that models a Physical Vector. The four basic operations and a pretty print function should be implemented. The Vector may be initialized in any reasonable way. The four operations to be implemented are: Related tasks:

**Requirements:**
- Start and end points, and direction

- Vector - Vector subtraction
- Vector * scalar multiplication
- Vector / scalar division
- Arrays
- Vector
