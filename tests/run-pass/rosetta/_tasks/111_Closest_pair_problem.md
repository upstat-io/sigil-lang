# Closest-pair problem

**Problem:** Provide a function to find the closest two points among a set of given points in two dimensions, i.e. to solve the Closest pair of points problem in the planar case. The straightforward solution is a O(n2) algorithm (which we can call brute-force algorithm); the pseudo-code (using indexes) could be simply: bruteForceClosestPair of P(1), P(2), ...

**Requirements:**
- Closest pair of points problem

**Success Criteria:**
- Program produces correct output for test cases
- Implementation matches Rosetta Code specification
