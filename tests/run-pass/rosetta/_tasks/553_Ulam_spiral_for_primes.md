# Ulam spiral (for primes)

**Problem:** An Ulam spiral (of primes) is a method of visualizing primes when expressed in a (normally counter-clockwise) outward spiral (usually starting at 1), constructed on a square grid, starting at the "center". An Ulam spiral is also known as a prime spiral. The first grid (green) is shown with sequential integers, starting at 1.

**Requirements:**
- Spiral matrix
- Zig-zag matrix
- Identity matrix
- Sequence of primes by Trial Division
- MathWorld entry: Prime Spiral

**Success Criteria:**
- Program produces correct output for test cases
- Implementation matches Rosetta Code specification
