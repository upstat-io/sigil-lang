# Character codes

**Problem:** Given a character value in your language, print its code (could be ASCII code, Unicode code, or whatever your language uses). The character 'a' (lowercase letter A) has a code of 97 in ASCII (as well as Unicode, as ASCII forms the beginning of Unicode). Conversely, given a code, print out the corresponding character.

**Requirements:**
- Implement the task according to the specification

**Success Criteria:**
- Program produces correct output for test cases
- Implementation matches Rosetta Code specification
