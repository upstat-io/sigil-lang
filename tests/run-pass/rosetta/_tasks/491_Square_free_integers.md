# Square-free integers

**Problem:** Write a function to test if a number is square-free. A square-free is an integer which is divisible by no perfect square other than 1 (unity). For this task, only positive square-free numbers will be used. Show here (on this page) all square-free integers (in a horizontal format) that are between: (One trillion = 1,000,000,000,000) Show here (on this page) the count of square-free integers from:
