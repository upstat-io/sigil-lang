# Loops/Nested

**Problem:** Show a nested loop which searches a two-dimensional array filled with random numbers uniformly distributed over [1,,20]. The loops iterate rows and columns of the array printing the elements until the value 20 is met. Specifically, this task also shows how to break out of nested loops. Related tasks:
