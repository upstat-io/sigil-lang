# Same fringe

**Problem:** Write a routine that will compare the leaves ("fringe") of two binary trees to determine whether they are the same list of leaves when visited left-to-right. The structure or balance of the trees does not matter; only the number, order, and value of the leaves is important. Any solution is allowed here, but many computer scientists will consider it inelegant to collect either fringe in its entirety before starting to collect the other one.

**Requirements:**
- Implement the task according to the specification

**Success Criteria:**
- Program produces correct output for test cases
- Implementation matches Rosetta Code specification
