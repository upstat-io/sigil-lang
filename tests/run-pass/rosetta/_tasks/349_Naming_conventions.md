# Naming conventions

**Problem:** Many languages have naming conventions regarding the identifiers used in the language, its libraries, and programs written in the language. Such conventions, which may be classified as de facto or de jure depending on how they are enforced, often take the form of rules regarding prefixes, suffixes, and the use of upper-case and lower-case characters. The naming conventions are sometimes a bit haphazard, especially if the language and/or library has gone through periods of evolution.

**Requirements:**
- Procedure and operator names. (Intrinsic or external)
- Class, Subclass and instance names.
- Built-in versus libraries names.

**Success Criteria:**
- Program produces correct output for test cases
- Implementation matches Rosetta Code specification
