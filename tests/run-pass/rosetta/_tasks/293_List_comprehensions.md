# List comprehensions

**Problem:** A list comprehension is a special syntax in some programming languages to describe lists. It is similar to the way mathematicians describe sets, with a set comprehension, hence the name. Some attributes of a list comprehension are: Write a list comprehension that builds the list of all Pythagorean triples with elements between 1 and n. If the language has multiple ways for expressing such a construct (for example, direct list comprehensions and generators), write one example for each.

**Requirements:**
- The syntax has parts corresponding to that of set-builder notation.

**Success Criteria:**
- They should be distinct from (nested) for loops and the use of map and filter functions within the syntax of the language.
- They should return either a list or an iterator (something that returns successive members of a collection, in order).
