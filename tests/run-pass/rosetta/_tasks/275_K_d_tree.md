# K-d tree

**Problem:** A k-d tree (short for k-dimensional tree) is a space-partitioning data structure for organizing points in a k-dimensional space. k-d trees are a useful data structure for several applications, such as searches involving a multidimensional search key (e.g. range searches and nearest neighbor searches). k-d trees are a special case of binary space partitioning trees. k-d trees are not suitable, however, for efficiently finding the nearest neighbor in high dimensional spaces.

**Requirements:**
- The Wikipedia example data of [(2,3), (5,4), (9,6), (4,7), (8,1), (7,2)].
- 1000 3-d points uniformly distributed in a 3-d cube.

**Success Criteria:**
- Program produces correct output for test cases
- Implementation matches Rosetta Code specification
