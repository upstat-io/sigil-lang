# Find duplicate files

**Problem:** In a large directory structure it is easy to inadvertently leave unnecessary copies of files around, which can use considerable disk space and create confusion. Create a program which, given a minimum size and a folder/directory, will find all files of at least size bytes with duplicate contents under the directory and output or show the sets of duplicate files in order of decreasing size.

**Requirements:**
- Create a program which, given a minimum size and a folder/directory, will find all files of at least size bytes with duplicate contents under the directory and output or show the sets of duplicate files in order of decreasing size.

**Success Criteria:**
- Program produces correct output for test cases
- Implementation matches Rosetta Code specification
