# Inheritance/Single

**Problem:** This task is about derived types; for implementation inheritance, see Polymorphism. Inheritance is an operation of type algebra that creates a new type from one or several parent types. The obtained type is called derived type. It inherits some of the properties of its parent types. Usually inherited properties are: The class of the new type is a subclass of the classes rooted in the parent types.

**Requirements:**
- methods
- components
- parts of the representation
- single, when only one parent is allowed
- multiple, otherwise

**Success Criteria:**
- Program produces correct output for test cases
- Implementation matches Rosetta Code specification
