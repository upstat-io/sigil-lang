# Multiple distinct objects

**Problem:** Create a sequence (array, list, whatever) consisting of n distinct, initialized items of the same type. n should be determined at runtime. By distinct we mean that if they are mutable, changes to one do not affect all others; if there is an appropriate equality operator they are considered unequal; etc. The code need not specify a particular kind of distinction, but do not use e.g. a numeric-range generator which does not generalize.

**Requirements:**
- n should be determined at runtime.
- The code need not specify a particular kind of distinction, but do not use e.g.

**Success Criteria:**
- Program produces correct output for test cases
- Implementation matches Rosetta Code specification
