# Sorting algorithms/Selection sort

**Problem:** Sort an array (or list) of elements using the Selection sort algorithm. It works as follows: First find the smallest element in the array and exchange it with the element in the first position, then find the second smallest element and exchange it with the element in the second position, and continue in this way until the entire array is sorted. Its asymptotic complexity is O(n2) making it inefficient on large arrays.

**Requirements:**
- Rosetta Code: O (complexity).

**Success Criteria:**
- Program produces correct output for test cases
- Implementation matches Rosetta Code specification
