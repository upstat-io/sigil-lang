# Substring/Top and tail

**Problem:** The task is to demonstrate how to remove the first and last characters from a string. The solution should demonstrate how to obtain the following results: If the program uses UTF-8 or UTF-16, it must work on any valid Unicode code point, whether in the Basic Multilingual Plane or above it. The program must reference logical characters (code points), not 8-bit code units for UTF-8 or 16-bit code units for UTF-16.

**Requirements:**
- String with first character removed
- String with last character removed
- String with both the first and last characters removed

**Success Criteria:**
- Program produces correct output for test cases
- Implementation matches Rosetta Code specification
