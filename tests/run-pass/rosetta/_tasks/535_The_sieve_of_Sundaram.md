# The sieve of Sundaram

**Problem:** The sieve of Eratosthenes: you've been there; done that; have the T-shirt. The sieve of Eratosthenes was ancient history when Euclid was a schoolboy. You are ready for something less than 3000 years old. You are ready for The sieve of Sundaram. Starting with the ordered set of +ve integers, mark every third starting at 4 (4;7;10...). Step through the set and if the value is not marked output 2*n+1. So from 1 to 4 output 3 5 7. 4 is marked so skip for 5 and 6 output 11 and 13.

**Requirements:**
- The article on Wikipedia.

**Success Criteria:**
- Program produces correct output for test cases
- Implementation matches Rosetta Code specification
