# Truncatable primes

**Problem:** A truncatable prime is a prime number that when you successively remove digits from one end of the prime, you are left with a new prime number. The number 997 is called a left-truncatable prime as the numbers 997, 97, and 7 are all prime. The number 7393 is a right-truncatable prime as the numbers 7393, 739, 73, and 7 formed by removing digits from its right are also prime. No zeroes are allowed in truncatable primes.

**Requirements:**
- Find largest left truncatable prime in a given base
- Sieve of Eratosthenes
- Truncatable Prime from MathWorld.]

**Success Criteria:**
- Program produces correct output for test cases
- Implementation matches Rosetta Code specification
