# Knapsack problem

**Problem:** In a knapsack problem, the goal is to maximize some value subject to a set of constraints. Though the continuous case is very simple, the discrete cases are NP-complete.

**Requirements:**
- Knapsack problem/Unbounded
- Knapsack problem/Bounded
- Knapsack problem/0-1
- Knapsack problem/Continuous

**Success Criteria:**
- Program produces correct output for test cases
- Implementation matches Rosetta Code specification
