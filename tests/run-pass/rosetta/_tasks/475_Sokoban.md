# Sokoban

**Problem:** Demonstrate how to find a solution to a given Sokoban level. For the purpose of this task (formally, a PSPACE-complete problem) any method may be used. However a move-optimal or push-optimal (or any other -optimal) solutions is preferred. Sokoban levels are usually stored as a character array where Sokoban solutions are usually stored in the LURD format, where lowercase l, u, r and d represent a move in that (left, up, right, down) direction and capital LURD represents a push.

**Requirements:**
- space is an empty square
- # is a wall
- @ is the player
- $ is a box
- . is a goal
- + is the player on a goal
- * is a box on a goal
- . $$ #

**Success Criteria:**
- Program produces correct output for test cases
- Implementation matches Rosetta Code specification
