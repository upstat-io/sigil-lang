# Compare a list of strings

**Problem:** Task Given a list of arbitrarily many strings, show how to: test if they are all lexically equal test if every string is lexically less than the one after it (i.e. whether the list is in strict ascending order) Each of those two tests should result in a single true or false value, which could be used as the condition of an if statement or similar.

**Requirements:**
- If the input list has less than two elements, the tests should always return true.
- There is no need to provide a complete program and output.
- Try to write your solution in a way that does not modify the original list, but if it does then please add a note to make that clear to readers.

**Success Criteria:**
- Task completed according to Rosetta Code specification
