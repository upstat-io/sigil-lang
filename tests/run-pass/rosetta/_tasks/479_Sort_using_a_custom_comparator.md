# Sort using a custom comparator

**Problem:** Sort an array (or list) of strings in order of descending length, and in ascending lexicographic order for strings of equal length. Use a sorting facility provided by the language/library, combined with your own callback comparison function. Note: Lexicographic order is case-insensitive.

**Requirements:**
- Implement the task according to the specification

**Success Criteria:**
- Program produces correct output for test cases
- Implementation matches Rosetta Code specification
