# Yellowstone sequence

**Problem:** The Yellowstone sequence, also called the Yellowstone permutation, is defined as: a(n) = the smallest number not already in sequence such that a(n) is relatively prime to a(n-1) and is not relatively prime to a(n-2). The sequence is a permutation of the natural numbers, and gets its name from what its authors felt was a spiking, geyser like appearance of a plot of the sequence.

**Requirements:**
- Greatest common divisor.
- Plot coordinate pairs.
- EKG sequence convergence
- The OEIS entry: A098550 The Yellowstone permutation.
- Applegate et al, 2015: The Yellowstone Permutation .

**Success Criteria:**
- Program produces correct output for test cases
- Implementation matches Rosetta Code specification
