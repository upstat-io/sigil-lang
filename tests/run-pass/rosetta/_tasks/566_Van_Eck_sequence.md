# Van Eck sequence

**Problem:** The sequence is generated by following this pseudo-code: A: The first term is zero. Repeatedly apply: If the last term is *new* to the sequence so far then: B: The next term is zero. C: The next term is how far back this last term occured previously. Using C: (zero last occurred two steps back - before the one) 0 0 1 0 2 0 Using C: (two last occurred two steps back - before the zero) 0 0 1 0 2 0 2 2 Using C: (two last occurred one step back) 0 0 1 0 2 0 2 2 1 Using C: (one last appeared six step

**Requirements:**
- Create a function/procedure/method/subroutine/... to generate the Van Eck sequence of numbers.
- Use it to display here, on this page:
- The first ten terms of the sequence.
- Terms 991 - to - 1000 of the sequence.
- Don't Know (the Van Eck Sequence) - Numberphile video.

**Success Criteria:**
- Program produces correct output for test cases
- Implementation matches Rosetta Code specification
