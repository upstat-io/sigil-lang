# Monte Carlo methods

**Problem:** A Monte Carlo Simulation is a way of approximating the value of a function where calculating the actual value is difficult or impossible. It uses random sampling to define constraints on the value and then makes a sort of "best guess." A simple Monte Carlo Simulation can be used to calculate the value for .

**Requirements:**
- Implement the task according to the specification

**Success Criteria:**
- Program produces correct output for test cases
- Implementation matches Rosetta Code specification
