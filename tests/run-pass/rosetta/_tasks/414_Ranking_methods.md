# Ranking methods

**Problem:** The numerical rank of competitors in a competition shows if one is better than, equal to, or worse than another based on their results in a competition. The numerical rank of a competitor can be assigned in several different ways. The following scores are accrued for all competitors of a competition (in best-first order): For each of the following ranking methods, create a function/method/procedure/subroutine...

**Requirements:**
- Standard. (Ties share what would have been their first ordinal number).
- Modified. (Ties share what would have been their last ordinal number).
- Dense. (Ties share the next available integer).
- Ordinal. ((Competitors take the next available integer. Ties are not treated otherwise).
- Fractional. (Ties share the mean of what would have been their ordinal numbers).

**Success Criteria:**
- Program produces correct output for test cases
- Implementation matches Rosetta Code specification
