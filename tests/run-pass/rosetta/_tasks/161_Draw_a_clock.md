# Draw a clock

**Problem:** Task Draw a clock. More specific: Draw a time keeping device. It can be a stopwatch, hourglass, sundial, a mouth counting "one thousand and one", anything. Only showing the seconds is required, e.g.: a watch with just a second hand will suffice. However, it must clearly change every second, and the change must cycle every so often (one minute, 30 seconds, etc.) It must be drawn; printing a string of numbers to your terminal doesn't qualify.

**Requirements:**
- fy. Both text-based and graphical drawing are OK.
- animate simple object
- timed event
- polling system resources
- code clarity

**Success Criteria:**
- Task completed according to Rosetta Code specification
