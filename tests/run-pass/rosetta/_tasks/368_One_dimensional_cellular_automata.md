# One-dimensional cellular automata

**Problem:** Assume an array of cells with an initial distribution of live and dead cells, and imaginary cells off the end of the array having fixed values. Cells in the next generation of the array are calculated based on the value of the cell and its left and right nearest neighbours in the current generation.

**Requirements:**
- Elementary cellular automaton

**Success Criteria:**
- Program produces correct output for test cases
- Implementation matches Rosetta Code specification
