# Variable declaration reset

**Problem:** A decidely non-challenging task to highlight a potential difference between programming languages. Using a straightforward longhand loop as in the JavaScript and Phix examples below, show the locations of elements which are identical to the immediately preceding element in {1,2,2,3,4,4,5}. The (non-blank) results may be 2,5 for zero-based or 3,6 if one-based. The purpose is to determine whether variable declaration (in block scope) resets the contents on every iteration.

**Requirements:**
- Using a straightforward longhand loop as in the JavaScript and Phix examples below, show the locations of elements which are identical to the immediately preceding element in {1,2,2,3,4,4,5}.

**Success Criteria:**
- Program produces correct output for test cases
- Implementation matches Rosetta Code specification
