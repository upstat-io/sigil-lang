# Harmonic series

**Problem:** In mathematics, the n-th harmonic number is the sum of the reciprocals of the first n natural numbers: Hn=1+12+13+&#x22EF;+1n=&#x2211;k=1n1k Hn = 1 + 1/2 + 1/3 + ... + 1/n The series of harmonic numbers thus obtained is often loosely referred to as the harmonic series. Harmonic numbers are closely related to the Riemann zeta function, and roughly approximate the natural logarithm function; differing by (lowercase Gamma), the Euler–Mascheroni constant.

**Requirements:**
- Write a function (routine, procedure, whatever it may be called in your language) to generate harmonic numbers.
- Use that procedure to show the values of the first 20 harmonic numbers.
- Find and show the position in the series of the first value greater than the integers 1 through 5
- Find and show the position in the series of the first value greater than the integers 6 through 10
- Egyptian fractions

**Success Criteria:**
- Program produces correct output for test cases
- Implementation matches Rosetta Code specification
