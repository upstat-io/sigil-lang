# Heronian triangles

**Problem:** Hero's formula for the area of a triangle given the length of its three sides a, b, and c is given by: where s is half the perimeter of the triangle; that is, Heronian triangles are triangles whose sides and area are all integers. An example is the triangle with sides 3, 4, 5 whose area is 6 (and whose perimeter is 12). Note that any triangle whose sides are all an integer multiple of 3, 4, 5; such as 6, 8, 10, will also be a Heronian triangle.

**Requirements:**
- Create a named function/method/procedure/... that implements Hero's formula.
- Use the function to generate all the primitive Heronian triangles with sides

**Success Criteria:**
- Program produces correct output for test cases
- Implementation matches Rosetta Code specification
