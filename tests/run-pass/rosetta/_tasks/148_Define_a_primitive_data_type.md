# Define a primitive data type

**Problem:** Demonstrate how to define a type that behaves like an integer but has a lowest valid value of 1 and a highest valid value of 10. Include all bounds checking you need to write, or explain how the compiler or interpreter creates those bounds checks for you.

**Requirements:**
- Include all bounds checking you need to write, or explain how the compiler or interpreter creates those bounds checks for you.

**Success Criteria:**
- Program produces correct output for test cases
- Implementation matches Rosetta Code specification
