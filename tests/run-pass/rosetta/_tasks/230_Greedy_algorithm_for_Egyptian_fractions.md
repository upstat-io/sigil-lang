# Greedy algorithm for Egyptian fractions

**Problem:** An Egyptian fraction is the sum of distinct unit fractions such as: {2} + {3} + {16} \,(= {48}) Each fraction in the expression has a numerator equal to 1 (unity) and a denominator that is a positive integer, and all the denominators are distinct (i.e., no repetitions).

**Requirements:**
- show the Egyptian fractions for: {48} and {121} and {59}
- for all proper fractions, {b} where a and b are positive one-or two-digit (decimal) integers, find and show an Egyptian fraction that has:
- the largest number of terms,
- the largest denominator.
- for all one-, two-, and three-digit integers, find and show (as above). {extra credit}
- Wolfram MathWorld entry: Egyptian fraction
- Numberphile YouTube video: Egyptian Fractions and the Greedy Algorithm

**Success Criteria:**
- Program produces correct output for test cases
- Implementation matches Rosetta Code specification
