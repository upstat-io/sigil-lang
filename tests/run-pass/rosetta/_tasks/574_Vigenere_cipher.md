# Vigenère cipher

**Problem:** Implement a Vigenère cypher, both encryption and decryption. The program should handle keys and text of unequal length, and should capitalize everything and discard non-alphabetic characters. (If your program handles non-alphabetic characters in another way, make a note of it.) Related tasks:
