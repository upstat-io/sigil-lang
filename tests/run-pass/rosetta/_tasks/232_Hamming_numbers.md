# Hamming numbers

**Problem:** Hamming numbers are numbers of the form H = 2i 3j 5k i, j, k ≥ 0 Hamming numbers are also known as ugly numbers and also 5-smooth numbers (numbers whose prime divisors are less or equal to 5). Generate the sequence of Hamming numbers, in increasing order. In particular: Related tasks: References:

**Requirements:**
- Show the first twenty Hamming numbers.
- Show the 1691st Hamming number (the last one below 231).
- Show the one millionth Hamming number (if the language – or a convenient library – supports arbitrary-precision integers).
- Humble numbers
- N-smooth numbers
- Hamming problem from Dr. Dobb's CodeTalk (dead link as of Sep 2011; parts of the thread here and here).

**Success Criteria:**
