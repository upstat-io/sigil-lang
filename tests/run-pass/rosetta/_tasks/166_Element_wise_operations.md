# Element-wise operations

**Problem:** This task is similar to: Implement basic element-wise matrix-matrix and scalar-matrix operations, which can be referred to in other, higher-order tasks. Extend the task if necessary to include additional basic operations, which should not require their own specialised task.

**Requirements:**
- Matrix multiplication
- Matrix transposition
- addition
- subtraction
- multiplication
- division
- exponentiation

**Success Criteria:**
- Program produces correct output for test cases
- Implementation matches Rosetta Code specification
