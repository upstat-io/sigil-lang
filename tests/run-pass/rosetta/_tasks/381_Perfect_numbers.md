# Perfect numbers

**Problem:** category:Discrete math Write a function which says whether a number is perfect. A perfect number is a positive integer that is the sum of its proper positive divisors excluding the number itself. Equivalently, a perfect number is a number that is half the sum of all of its positive divisors (including itself). Note: The faster Lucas-Lehmer test is used to find primes of the form 2n-1, all known perfect numbers can be derived from these primes using the formula (2n - 1) × 2n - 1.

**Requirements:**
- Rational Arithmetic
- Perfect numbers on OEIS
- Odd Perfect showing the current status of bounds on odd perfect numbers.

**Success Criteria:**
- Program produces correct output for test cases
- Implementation matches Rosetta Code specification
