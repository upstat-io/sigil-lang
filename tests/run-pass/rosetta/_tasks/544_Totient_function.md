# Totient function

**Problem:** The totient function is also known as: Definitions (as per number theory): The totient function: If the totient number (for N) is one less than N, then N is prime. Create a totient function and: Show all output here.

**Requirements:**
- Euler's totient function
- Euler's phi totient function
- phi totient function
- counts the integers up to a given positive integer n that are relatively prime to n
- counts the integers k in the range 1 ≤ k ≤ n for which the greatest common divisor gcd(n,k) is equal to 1
- counts numbers ≤ n and prime to n
- Find and display (1 per line) for the 1st 25 integers:
- the totient number for that integer
- indicate if that integer is prime
- Find and display the count of the primes up to 100

**Success Criteria:**
- Program produces correct output for test cases
- Implementation matches Rosetta Code specification
