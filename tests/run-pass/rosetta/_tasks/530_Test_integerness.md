# Test integerness

**Problem:** Mathematically, This means that each of those larger sets, and the data types used to represent them, include some integers. Given a rational, real, or complex number of any type, test whether it is mathematically an integer. Your code should handle all numeric data types commonly used in your programming language. Discuss any limitations of your code.

**Requirements:**
- the integers Z are included in the rational numbers Q,
- which are included in the real numbers R,
- which can be generalized to the complex numbers C.

**Success Criteria:**
- Program produces correct output for test cases
- Implementation matches Rosetta Code specification
