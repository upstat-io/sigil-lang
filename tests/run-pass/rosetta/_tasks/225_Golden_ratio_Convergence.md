# Golden ratio/Convergence

**Problem:** The golden ratio can be defined as the continued fraction Thus = 1 + {1/}. Multiplying both sides by and solving the resulting quadratic equation for its positive solution, one gets = (1 + )/2 1.61803398875. The golden ratio has the slowest convergence of any continued fraction, as one might guess by noting that the denominators are made of the smallest positive integer.

**Requirements:**
- Implement the task according to the specification

**Success Criteria:**
- Program produces correct output for test cases
- Implementation matches Rosetta Code specification
