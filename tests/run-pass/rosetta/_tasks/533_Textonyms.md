# Textonyms

**Problem:** When entering text on a phone's digital pad it is possible that a particular combination of digits corresponds to more than one word. Such are called textonyms. Assuming the digit keys are mapped to letters as follows: Write a program that finds textonyms in a list of words such as Textonyms/wordlist or unixdict.txt. The task should produce a report: There are #{0} words in #{1} which can be represented by the digit key mapping. They require #{2} digit combinations to represent them.

**Requirements:**
- {3} digit combinations represent Textonyms.
- {0} is the number of words in the list which can be represented by the digit key mapping.
- {1} is the URL of the wordlist being used.
- {2} is the number of digit combinations required to represent the words in #{0}.
- {3} is the number of #{2} which represent more than one word.

**Success Criteria:**
- Program produces correct output for test cases
- Implementation matches Rosetta Code specification
