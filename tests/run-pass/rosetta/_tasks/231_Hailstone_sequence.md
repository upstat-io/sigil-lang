# Hailstone sequence

**Problem:** The Hailstone sequence of numbers can be generated from a starting positive integer, n by: The (unproven) Collatz conjecture is that the hailstone sequence for any starting number always terminates. This sequence was named by Lothar Collatz in 1937 (or possibly in 1939), and is also known as (the): The hailstone sequence is also known as hailstone numbers (because the values are usually subject to multiple descents and ascents like hailstones in a cloud).

**Requirements:**
- If n is 1 then the sequence ends.
- If n is even then the next n of the sequence = n/2
- If n is odd then the next n of the sequence = (3 * n) + 1
- hailstone sequence, hailstone numbers
- 3x + 2 mapping, 3n + 1 problem
