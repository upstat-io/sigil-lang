# Magic squares of odd order

**Problem:** A magic square is an NxN square matrix whose numbers (usually integers) consist of consecutive numbers arranged so that the sum of each row and column, and both long (main) diagonals are equal to the same sum (which is called the magic number or magic constant). The numbers are usually (but not always) the first N2 positive integers. A magic square whose rows and columns add up to a magic number but whose main diagonals do not, is known as a semimagic square.

**Requirements:**
- Magic squares of singly even order
- Magic squares of doubly even order
- MathWorld entry: Magic_square

**Success Criteria:**
- Program produces correct output for test cases
- Implementation matches Rosetta Code specification
