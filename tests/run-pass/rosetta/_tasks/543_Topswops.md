# Topswops

**Problem:** Topswops is a card game created by John Conway in the 1970's. Assume you have a particular permutation of a set of n cards numbered 1..n on both of their faces, for example the arrangement of four cards given by [2, 4, 1, 3] where the leftmost card is on top. A round is composed of reversing the first m cards where m is the value of the topmost card. Rounds are repeated until the topmost card is the number 1 and the number of swaps is recorded.

**Requirements:**
- Number reversal game
- Sorting algorithms/Pancake sort

**Success Criteria:**
- Program produces correct output for test cases
- Implementation matches Rosetta Code specification
