# Index finite lists of positive integers

**Problem:** It is known that the set of finite lists of positive integers is countable. This means that there exists a subset of natural integers which can be mapped to the set of finite lists of positive integers. Implement such a mapping: Demonstrate your solution by: There are many ways to do this. Feel free to choose any one you like. Extra credit: Make the rank function as a bijection and show unrank(n) for n varying from 0 to 10.

**Requirements:**
- write a function rank which assigns an integer to any finite, arbitrarily long list of arbitrary large positive integers.
- write a function unrank which is the rank inverse function.
- picking a random-length list of random positive integers
- turn it into an integer, and
- get the list back.

**Success Criteria:**
- Program produces correct output for test cases
- Implementation matches Rosetta Code specification
