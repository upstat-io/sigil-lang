# Inner classes

**Problem:** In object-oriented programming, an inner or nested class is a class declared entirely within the body of another class or interface. It is not the same as a subclass which is a class which inherits members from another class or classes and can be declared anywhere the parent class(es) are within scope. However, inner classes may nevertheless be subclasses of other classes as well.

**Requirements:**
- Classes

**Success Criteria:**
- Program produces correct output for test cases
- Implementation matches Rosetta Code specification
