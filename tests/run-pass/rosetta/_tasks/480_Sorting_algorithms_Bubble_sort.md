# Sorting algorithms/Bubble sort

**Problem:** A bubble sort is generally considered to be the simplest sorting algorithm. A bubble sort is also known as a sinking sort. Because of its simplicity and ease of visualization, it is often taught in introductory computer science courses. Because of its abysmal O(n2) performance, it is not used often for large (or even medium-sized) datasets. The bubble sort works by passing sequentially over a list, comparing each value to the one immediately after it.
