// Test that assigning to an immutable ($) binding is a compile error (E2039)
// Spec: 05-variables.md § Immutable Bindings
//
// Bindings declared with `$` prefix cannot be reassigned.
// The type checker rejects assignment to immutable bindings at compile time.
// Note: `$` is a binding modifier — the variable is referenced as `x`, not `$x`.
